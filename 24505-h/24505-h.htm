v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Disappointment expressed by others and felt by myself that a History of
the Forest of Dean should never have appeared in print, and an impression
that a considerable amount of interesting information relative to it might
be brought together, combined I may add with the fact that there seemed no
probability of such a work being otherwise undertaken until old usages and
traditions had passed away, have induced me to attempt its
compilation.&nbsp; I here venture to publish the fruit of my labours, in
the hope that the reader may derive some portion of that pleasure which the
prosecution of the work has afforded me, and trusting that the same
indulgent consideration which led the officers of the Government, the
gentlemen of the neighbourhood, and many of the intelligent Foresters to
aid in the execution, will by them and the public be extended to the work
itself.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to make it as complete as possible by supplying every
known circumstance, mostly in the words of the original narrator, and yet
trying so to harmonize the whole as to engage the attention of the general
reader, but more particularly of the residents in the district, by
acquainting them with the past and present state of one of the most
interesting and remarkable localities in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The district known as &ldquo;the Forest of Dean&rdquo; is situated
within that part of Gloucestershire which is bounded by the rivers Severn
and Wye.&nbsp; Its name is of doubtful origin.&nbsp; Was it so called from
its proximity to the town of Mitcheldean, or Dean Magna, mentioned in
Domesday Book, and which, agreeably to its name, is situated in a wooded
valley, the word &ldquo;Dean,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dene,&rdquo; being Saxon,
and signifying a dale or den?&mdash;or do we accept the statement of
Giraldus, and some other writers, that the Forest of Dean obtained its name
from the Danes sheltering themselves in it, secured by its shades and <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>thickets from
the retaliation of the neighbouring people, whose country they had
devastated?&mdash;Or, again, do we &ldquo;fancy,&rdquo; with Camden, that
&ldquo;by cutting off a syllable it is derived from Arden, which word the
Gauls and Britons heretofore seemed to have used for a wood, since two very
great forests, the one in Gallia Belgica, the other amongst us in
Warwickshire, are called by one and the same name, Arden&rdquo;?&nbsp; This
latter suggestion Evelyn, in his &lsquo;Sylva,&rsquo; accepts, in which he
is supported by the fact that the name of &ldquo;Dean&rdquo; is first met
with in William the Norman&rsquo;s survey.</p>
<p>Probably the earliest trace of this locality being inhabited exists in
the Druidical rocks which are found on the high lands on the
Gloucestershire side of the Wye.&nbsp; The chief of them is &ldquo;the Buck
Stone,&rdquo; so called perhaps from the deer which sheltered beneath it,
or else from its fancied resemblance to that animal when viewed from
certain distant spots.&nbsp; It is a huge mass of rock poised on the very
crest of Staunton Hill, which being of a pyramidal form, and almost 1000
feet high, renders the stone on its summit visible in one direction as far
as Ross, nine miles off.&nbsp; A careful examination of the structure of
the rock, and particularly of the character of its base, will show that its
position is natural.&nbsp; But that the Druids had appropriated it to
sacrificial purposes, is evident from a rudely hollowed stone which lies
adjacent.&nbsp; In shape &ldquo;the Buck Stone&rdquo; is almost flat on the
top, and four-sided, the north-east side measuring sixteen feet five
inches, the north seventeen feet, the south-west nine feet, and the south
side twelve feet.&nbsp; The face of the rock on which it rests slopes
considerably, and the bearing point is only two feet across.&nbsp; This
part may be an unbroken neck of rock, but apparently the entire block has
crushed down upon its base, as though, from having once formed the
extremity of the portion of cliff near, it had fallen away, and had
accidentally balanced itself in its present position. <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp;
The texture of &ldquo;the Buck <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Stone&rdquo; is similar to that of the slab of
rock on which it rests, commonly known as the old red sandstone
conglomerate of quartz pebbles (a stratum of which extends through the
whole district), exceedingly hard in most of its veins, but very perishable
in others; and hence perhaps the form and origin of this singular
object.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p3.jpg">
<img alt="The Buck Stone" src="images/p3.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In addition to the above, there is a large mass of grit-stone, from nine
to ten feet high, standing in a field on the north side of the road leading
from Bream to St. Briavel&rsquo;s, named &ldquo;the Long
Stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another, called by the same name, and of similar
character, occurs on the north-east side of the Staunton and Coleford road;
<!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>but
nothing remarkable is known of either of them, only their weather-worn
appearance shows that they have been exposed to the action of the elements
during many centuries.</p>
<p>Next in order of time to the above remains are the ancient Iron-mines,
locally termed &ldquo;Scowles,&rdquo; <a name="citation4"></a><a
href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a> which were undoubtedly worked
when this island was occupied by the Romans.&nbsp; This appears certain
from the coins, &amp;c., which have been found deeply buried in the heaps
of iron cinders derived from the workings of these mines.&nbsp; A highly
interesting MS. Dissertation, written about the year 1780 by Mr. Wyrrall,
on the ancient iron-works of the Forest, a subject on which he was well
informed, being a resident in the neighbourhood, is conclusive on this
head.&nbsp; He states:&mdash;&ldquo;Coins, fibula, and other things known
to be in use with that people (the Romans), have been frequently found in
the beds of cinders at certain places: this has occurred particularly at
the village of Whitchurch, between Ross and Monmouth, where large stacks of
cinders have been found, and some of them so deep in the earth, eight or
ten feet under the surface, as to demonstrate without other proof that they
must have lain there for a great number of ages.&nbsp; The present writer
has had opportunities of seeing many of these coins and fibula, &amp;c.,
which have been picked up by the workmen in getting the cinders at this
place, in his time; but especially one coin of Trajan, which he remembers
to be surprisingly perfect and fresh, considering the length of time it
must have been in the ground.&nbsp; Another instance occurs to his
recollection of a little image of brass, about four inches long, which was
then found in the cinders at the same place, being a very elegant female
figure, in a dancing attitude, and evidently an antique by the
drapery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Numerous additional traces of the same people have been discovered in
this neighbourhood, viz., a Roman pavement, tesser&aelig;, bricks, and
tiles at Whitchurch, <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>already mentioned; remains of Ariconium, a town,
it seems, of blacksmiths, at Bollitree; a camp, bath, and tessellated
pavement at Lydney; and coins to a large amount, indicative of considerable
local prosperity, on the Coppet Woodhill, at Lydbrook, Perry Grove, and
Crabtree Hill&mdash;of Philip, Gallienus, Victorinus, Claudius Gothicus,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Crabtree Hill being situated near the centre of the Forest, renders the
discovery of Roman antiquities there especially interesting.&nbsp; On 27th
August, 1839, a man who was employed to raise some stone in Crabtree Hill,
of which several heaps were lying on the surface, in turning over the stone
found about twenty-five Roman coins.&nbsp; The next day, in another heap
about fifty yards distant, he found a broken jar or urn of baked clay, and
400 or 500 coins lying by it, the coins being for the most part those of
Claudius II., Gallienus, and Victorinus.&nbsp; The spot is rather high
ground, but not a hill or commanding point, and there do not appear any
traces of a camp near it.&nbsp; Some of the stones seemed burnt, as if the
building had been destroyed by fire.&nbsp; There was no appearance of
mortar, but the stones had evidently been used in building, and part of the
foundation of a wall remained visible.&nbsp; A silver coin of Aurelius was
likewise picked up.</p>
<p>Similar discoveries have been made in other places.&nbsp; At
Seddlescombe, in Sussex, one of the earliest iron-making localities in the
kingdom, Mr. Wright, in his interesting work entitled &lsquo;Wanderings of
an Antiquary,&rsquo; mentions several Roman coins, especially one of the
Emperor Diocletian, having been met with in a bed of iron cinders,
manifestly of great antiquity, since four large oaks stood upon its
surface.</p>
<p>An interval of a few hundred years brings us to the probable date of the
next class of antiquities, viz. the military earthworks yet traceable in
the neighbourhood.&nbsp; They are four in number, commencing with the lines
of circumvallation which enclose the promontory of Beachley; next, the camp
and entrenchments on the high lands of Tidenham Chase; then, a camp near
the <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>Bearse Common; and, as a termination to the chain, the triple dyke
defending Symmond&rsquo;s Yat.&nbsp; Some have regarded these remains as
forming the southern termination of Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, which that sovereign
constructed about the year 760, to prevent the Welsh from invading his
kingdom of Mercia; but they are not sufficiently uniform or continuous to
warrant such a conclusion.&nbsp; They seem rather to be connected with the
incident which the Chronicles of Florentius Vigorniensis relate as taking
place <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 912:&mdash;&ldquo;The Pagan pirates,
who nearly nineteen years before had retired from Britain, approaching by
the province of Gaul, called Lydivinum, return with two leaders, Ohterus
and Hroaldus, to England, and, sailing round West Saxonia and Cornubia, at
length reach the mouth of the river Sabrina (Severn), and, without delay,
invade the northern lands of the British, and, exploring all the parts
adjoining the bank of the river, pillage most of them.&nbsp; Cymelgeac, a
British bishop who occupied the plains of Yrcenefeld (Archenfield), was
likewise taken; and they, not a little rejoicing, carry him off to their
ships, whom, not long after, King Edward ransomed for forty pounds of
silver.&nbsp; Soon after, the whole force, leaving their ships, return to
the aforesaid plains, and make their way for the sake of plunder; but
suddenly as many of the inhabitants as possible of the adjoining towns of
Hereford and Glevum (Gloucester) assemble, and give them battle.&nbsp;
Hroaldus, the leader of the enemy, and his brother Ohterus, the other
leader, with a large part of the army, are slain.&nbsp; The rest are put to
flight, and driven by the Christians into a certain fence (septum), where
they are at length besieged, until they give hostages, so that as fast as
possible they depart King Edward&rsquo;s realm.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Fryer, of
Coleford, ingeniously supposes that Symmond&rsquo;s Rock was the scene of
the above contest, which may possibly be correct.</p>
<p>Edward the Confessor is stated in Domesday Book to have exempted the
Forest of Dean from taxation, with the object apparently of preserving it
from spoliation.&nbsp; <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>The exact terms used are, &ldquo;<i>has tras
c&rsquo; cessit rex E. quietas a geldo pro foresta custod</i>,&rdquo;
manifesting an interest in its protection on the part of the Crown, to
which no doubt it had now become annexed.&nbsp; Probably in those early
days the King possessed the right to all lands not under cultivation or
already apportioned, just as the Sovereign of our own day exercises the
right in our colonial territories, and makes specific grants to private
individuals.&nbsp; Thus, Mr. Rudder, in his &lsquo;History of
Gloucestershire,&rsquo; remarks that &ldquo;originally all the lands of the
subject are derived from the Crown, and our forests may have been made when
the ancient kings had the greater part in their own hands.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Agreeably with which principle, combined with the attractions which the
Forest of Dean possessed as a hunting ground, it was sometimes visited for
the sports of the chase by William the Conqueror, who in the year 1069 was
thus diverting himself when he received information that the Danes had
invaded Yorkshire and taken its chief city.&nbsp; Roused to fury by these
tidings, he swore &ldquo;by the splendour of the Almighty&rdquo; that
&ldquo;not one Northumbrian should escape his revenge;&rdquo; an oath which
he put into prompt and terrible execution.&nbsp; It seems not improbable
that upon one of these royal visits the miners of the Forest applied for
and obtained their &ldquo;customes and franchises,&rdquo; which, even in
the less remote days of Edward I., were granted, as the record of them
declares, &ldquo;time out of minde.&rdquo;&nbsp; The demand which the
Conqueror made upon the citizens of Gloucester for thirty-six
&ldquo;Icres&rdquo; of iron yearly, each of which comprised ten bars, made
at their forges, six in number, wherewith to furnish his fleet with nails,
was procured doubtless from this Forest, for which impost the above-named
grant was possibly designed as a compensation.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Annals&rsquo; of Giraldus, relative to the reign of Henry I.,
inform us that the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, or Brulails was now built
by Milo Fitz-Walter, with the design of confirming the royal authority in
the neighbourhood, and of checking the inroads of the Welsh; <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>but, extensive as
its ruins still are, they seem to contain no trace of so early a
period.&nbsp; The only vestige of that age is seen in the Parish Church,
which stands opposite the north entrance of the castle.&nbsp; Henry created
Fitz-Walter Earl of Hereford, and committed the castle of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s, and the district adjoining, to his care.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Itinerary&rsquo; of the same writer speaks of &ldquo;the noble
Forest of Dean, by which Gloucester was amply supplied with iron and
venison.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tithes of the latter were given by this King to the
Abbey there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p8.jpg">
<img alt="South side of the Nave in St. Briavel&rsquo;s Church"
src="images/p8.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the fifth year of the succeeding reign of Stephen, by whom the gifts
just mentioned were confirmed, the Forest of Dean, that is, its royal
quitrents, were granted to Lucy, Milo Fitz-Walter&rsquo;s third daughter,
upon her marrying Herbert Fitz-Herbert, the King&rsquo;s chamberlain, and
progenitor to the present Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery.&nbsp; So profuse
a gift on such an occasion may seem almost incredible; but its tenure, we
must remember, was precarious, the Forest itself being continually exposed
to danger by its proximity to the Welsh border.&nbsp; Mahel was this
lady&rsquo;s youngest brother, of whom Camden records that &ldquo;the
judgment of God overtook him for his rapacious ways, inhumane cruelties,
and boundless avarice, always usurping other men&rsquo;s rights.&nbsp; For,
being courteously treated at the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s by Walter de
Clifford, the castle taking fire, he lost his life by the <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>fall of a stone on his
head from the highest tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; It should be observed, however,
that, according to Sir R. C. Hoare, Camden is mistaken in placing the scene
of Mahel&rsquo;s catastrophe in the Forest of Dean; Brendlais, or Bynllys,
as mentioned by Giraldus, being a small village on the road between
Hereford and Hay, where a stately tower marks the site of the ancient
castle of the Cliffords, in which most likely this tyrant lost his
life.</p>
<p>In this year also, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1140, the Abbey of
Flaxley was founded by Roger, the Earl of Hereford&rsquo;s eldest son, by
whom it was partially endowed, and who named it &ldquo;the Abbey of St.
Mary de Dene,&rdquo; the site being formerly included in the precincts of
the Forest.&nbsp; The institution of the Abbey was confirmed by Henry II.,
who further enriched it by granting permission to the monks to feed their
cattle, hogs, &amp;c., in the Forest, repair their buildings with its
timber, and have an iron-forge there.&nbsp; In course of years the
Fitz-Herbert interest in the Forest and Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s,
passing through the families of Henry de Bohun and Bernard de Newmarch, was
released by the former to King John, who granted them at the close of his
reign to John de Monmouth.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Itinerary&rsquo; of this
monarch shows that he often visited the neighbourhood, no doubt for the
diversions of the chase, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>Judging from the architectural character of the remains of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, the whole of which seem to belong to the middle of
the thirteenth century, and closely to resemble in several features the
neighbouring castles of Chepstow and Goodrich, viz. in their entrances,
angular-headed arches, and three-cornered <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>buttresses, the present
building was probably erected by John de Monmouth, at the cost of the
Crown, paid out of the increasing receipts which now accrued to it from the
charges levied upon the iron mines and forges at work in the
district.&nbsp; The latter, being itinerant forges, were ordered to cease
until the King, Henry III., should command otherwise, which appears to have
led to the Chief Justice in Eyre directing that none should have an
iron-forge in the Forest without a special licence from the Sovereign.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p11.jpg">
<img alt="Entrance to St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle from the North"
src="images/p11.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>By royal permission the Abbot of Flaxley possessed both an itinerant and
a stationary forge; one of the former kind also belonged to the men of
Cantelupe.&nbsp; Henry Earl of Warwick had likewise forges in his woods at
Lydney, as well as others in the Forest, and <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>these formed no doubt
but a small part of the whole number.&nbsp; The dimensions of these forges
may be judged of by the two at Flaxley consuming more than two oaks weekly,
to the destruction of much timber, in lieu of which the King gave the Abbey
872 acres of woodland, which still forms part of the property at the
present day, under the name of &ldquo;the Abbot&rsquo;s Woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the long reign of Henry III. pasturage was granted to the men of
Rodley, who also in common with the King&rsquo;s people might hunt the
boar.&nbsp; Commonage was likewise given to the Abbot of Flaxley.&nbsp; The
bailiwick of Dean Magna was granted to Walter Wither.&nbsp; The men of Awre
were allowed, by custom, pasturage in the Forest; those of Rodley, estover,
dead and dry wood, with pannage and food for cattle as well.</p>
<p>The earliest of the various perambulations of the Forest, in the ensuing
reign of Edward I., was in the year 1282, and comprised the peninsula
formed by the Severn and Wye, proceeding north-east as far as Newent, and
north to Ross, as in fact it had always done.&nbsp; It may be also observed
that about this period the Abbot of Gloucester purchased thirty-six acres
of land in Hope Maloysell, held by Gilbert and Julian Lepiatte, receiving
also Thomas Dunn&rsquo;s gift of all his lands in the same parish.&nbsp;
The most ancient of the justice seats for these parts sat the same year at
Gloucester Castle.&nbsp; By its proceedings, some of the records of which
happily still exist, we learn that upwards of seventy-two
&ldquo;<i>Forge&aelig; errantes</i>,&rdquo; or moveable forges, were found
here; that the sum which the Crown charged for licensing them was at the
rate of seven shillings a year, viz. three shillings and six pence for six
months, or one shilling and nine pence a quarter; that a miner received one
penny, or the worth of it in ore, for each load brought to any of the
King&rsquo;s ironworks; but if conveyed out of the Forest the penny was
paid to the Crown; and that in those cases where a forge was farmed,
forty-six shillings was charged. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; No less than fifty-nine
mines were let at <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>this time to Henry de Chaworth, who had besides
forges at work in the Forest.</p>
<p>A careful examination of the oldest copy extant of &lsquo;The
Miners&rsquo; Laws and Privileges,&rsquo; regarded, as Mr. Wyrrall tells
us, writing in the year 1780, &ldquo;as the Magna Charta of our miners and
colliers,&rdquo; incontrovertibly proves that it belongs to this
period.&nbsp; It was first printed by William Cooper, at the Pelican in
Little Britain, 1687, from a manuscript copy preserved in the office of the
Deputy Gaveller, to which a postscript is added, &ldquo;written out of a
parchm<sup>t</sup>. roll, now in y<sup>e</sup> hands of Richard Morse of
Clowerwall, 7 June, 1673, by Tho: Davies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Richard Morse was
then one of the deputy gavellers.&nbsp; The date of the compilation has
heretofore been considered as determined by the wording of the short
introduction with which it is prefaced, commencing thus&mdash;&ldquo;Bee
itt in minde and Remembrance what y<sup>e</sup> Customes and Franchises
hath been that were granted tyme out of Minde, and after in tyme of the
Excellent and redoubted Prince, King Edward, unto the Miners of the Forrest
of Deane, and the Castle of St. Briavells,&rdquo; &amp;c., in which words
it will be observed that only the name of King Edward is mentioned, the
number not being added, although for some cause or other all modern copies
insert &ldquo;the Third,&rdquo; and hence the impression that the
collection was then formed; whereas the description given in the paragraph
immediately following, specifying what were then the limits of the Forest,
shows its date to be that of the first of the Edwards, since the bounds are
therein recorded as extending &ldquo;between Chepstowe Bridge and
Gloucester Bridge, the halfe deale of Newent, Rosse Ash, Monmouth Bridge,
and soe farr into the Seassoames as the blast of a horne or the voice of a
man may bee heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; But these limits ceased to prevail soon
after the beginning of the fourteenth century, and consequently an earlier
date must be assigned for the above record than has commonly been given to
it.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>The body of the document, originally, it would seem, unbroken, as
now printed is divided into forty-two paragraphs or sections, but expressed
in very rude and involved phraseology, confirming its antiquity, as still
further appears by the nature of the incidents which it contains.&nbsp; It
specifies, first of all, the franchises of the mine, meaning its liberties
or privileges, as not to be trespassed against, and consisting apparently
in this, that every man who possessed it might, with the approval of the
King&rsquo;s gaveller, dig for iron ore or coal where he pleased, and have
right of way for the carrying of it, although in certain cases
&ldquo;forbids&rdquo; to sell might be declared.&nbsp; A third part of the
profits of the undertaking belonged to the King, whose gaveller called at
the works every Tuesday &ldquo;between Mattens and Masse,&rdquo; and
received one penny from each miner, the fellowship supplying the Crown with
twelve charges of ore per week at twelve pence, or three charges of coal at
one penny.&nbsp; Timber was allowed for the use of the works above and
below ground.&nbsp; Only such persons as had been born and were abiding in
the Forest were to &ldquo;visit&rdquo; the mines, in working which the
distance of a stone&rsquo;s throw was always to be kept, and property in
them might be bequeathed.&nbsp; The miners&rsquo; clothes and light are
mentioned, and the standard measure called &ldquo;bellis,&rdquo; to the
exclusion of carts and &ldquo;waynes.&rdquo;&nbsp; It alludes to &ldquo;the
court of the wood,&rdquo; at the &ldquo;speech&rdquo; before the Verderers,
but more particularly to the court for debtors at St. Briavel&rsquo;s
Castle, and to the mine court, as regulated by the constable, clerk, and
gaveller, and the miners&rsquo; jury of twelve, twenty-four, or
forty-eight, where all causes relating to the mines were to be heard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Three hands,&rdquo; or three witnesses, were required in evidence,
and the oath was taken with a stick of holly held in the hand.&nbsp; The
miners of Mitchel Deane, Little Deane, and Ruer Deane are called
&ldquo;beneath the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It also appears that at Carleon, Newport, Barkley, Monmouth, and
Trelleck, the manufacture of iron was carried on by &ldquo;smiths,&rdquo;
who were connected with smith-holders living in the Forest, and supplying
the ore, at <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>each of which places it is remarkable that iron cinders have been
found.&nbsp; The document concludes with the names of the forty-eight
miners by whom it was witnessed, confirmed, and sealed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p15.jpg">
<img alt="Map of limits of the Forest" src="images/p15.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Such then were the mining privileges and regulations existing amongst
the operatives of the Forest at this period, <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1300, which by their settled and methodical
character bear out the statement made in the preface to &ldquo;the
Customes,&rdquo; &amp;c., that they had been then granted &ldquo;time out
of mind,&rdquo; and consequently were more ancient than the sieges of
Berwick, to which it appears many of the Forest miners and bowmen were
summoned, and perhaps received for services then rendered their peculiar
rights.</p>
<p>Another important characteristic of this reign (Edward I.) is the
unsettled state of the Forest boundaries, as indicated in the various
perambulations which were made about this time.&nbsp; A record of that made
in 1302 is preserved in the Tower of London, whilst the register of the
perambulation performed by Letters Patent the year following, exists in
Walter Froucester&rsquo;s transcript of it, in the possession of the Dean
and Chapter of Gloucester.&nbsp; Both documents agree in setting forth the
same limits, no longer extending to Gloucester, Chepstow, and Monmouth, or
even including Hewelsfield, Alvington, Ailberton, Lydney, Purton, Box,
Rodley, Westbury, Blaisdon, Huntley, Longhope, Newent, Taynton, Tibberton,
Highnam, Churcham, and Bulley as formerly; but confining them, as nearly as
can now be determined, to the bounds laid down in the accompanying map of
the district.&nbsp; It appears that these perambulations were made by a
numerous and important staff of officers, comprising four King&rsquo;s
justices especially appointed, the chief justice in Eyre, nine foresters in
fee, four verderers, and twenty-four jurors&mdash;such was the importance
then attached to those acts.</p>
<p>There are some further items of information extant of this date, viz.
the ten bailiwicks of &ldquo;Abbenhalle, Blakeney, Berse, Bicknoure, Great
Dean, Little Dean, Stauntene, Le Lee, and Bleyght&rsquo;s Ballye, and <!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Ruardean,&rdquo; held respectively by Ralph de Abbenhalle, Walter
de Astune, William Wodeard, Cecilia de Michegros, the Constable of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, Richard de la More, John de la Lee, Alexander
Bleyght, and Alexander de Byknore; Henry de Chaworth had fifty-nine mines,
and some forges; the timber wood of Kilcote was held by Bogo de Knoville;
William Bliss held 180 acres of assart, and seventeen acres of meadow land;
certain miners, named William de Abbensale, Walter and Elys Page, had been
found digging mine at Ardlonde belonging to the Abbot of Flaxley, who at
once removed them, and filled up the place.&nbsp; The question was now also
raised as to the Crown possessing the right of conferring the tithes of the
&ldquo;assarted&rdquo; (rooted up) Forest lands, not being within the
bounds of any of the adjacent churches; when it was decided in the
affirmative, the King exercising the claim in favour of the church of
Newland, in consideration, probably, of the lordship of the manor being
held by him, and the whole being formerly comprised in the Forest.&nbsp; A
considerable proportion of such of the existing encroachments as are
reputed the oldest pay tithes to Newland, a circumstance confirmatory of
their alleged antiquity. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>The records we possess of the ensuing reign of Edward II. afford
the interesting intelligence that on various public occasions the military
services of the Foresters were required, and even at places as distant as
Berwick-upon-Tweed, which, owing to its position as a border town, and the
contests then waging between the English and Scotch, was repeatedly lost
and won by both sides.&nbsp; From the year 1174 to 1482 it changed owners
upwards of sixteen times.&nbsp; The sieges to which our choice Foresters
were summoned appear to have been those of 1310, 1311, 1315, 1317, 1319,
and 1355.&nbsp; On the first occasion the Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s,
and Keeper of the Forest of Dean, was commanded to select one hundred
archers and twelve miners.&nbsp; In the following year writs were addressed
to the Sheriff of Gloucester, directing that, out of fifty men to be chosen
from the county, the larger number should be from the Forest of Dean, and
urging expedition in sending them.&nbsp; The next writ, issued four years
afterwards, was sent to the Sheriff of Herefordshire, and is entitled
&ldquo;Concerning the Choice of Soldiers in the Forest of Dean,&rdquo; and
orders ninety-six men of those parts to be provided.&nbsp; Two years later
the Keeper of St. Briavel&rsquo;s is directed to bring two hundred men to
Northallerton; and again, two years afterwards, he is to take twenty of the
strongest miners in his bailiwick to Newcastle-upon-Tyne; and a writ was
addressed to all mayors, sheriffs, bailiffs, &amp;c., reciting the
aforesaid instructions, and commanding that assistance should be rendered
them whenever it was needed during their journey.&nbsp; In connexion with
these incidents, it is stated by Guthrie, the historian, that Sir Edward
Manny bringing engineers out of the Forest of Dean, and Edward III.
investing the place with a prodigious army, the Scots capitulated.&nbsp;
They were also ordered by the same King to join his forces at Portsmouth in
1346 and 1359.</p>
<p>From these facts we are justified in concluding that the population then
inhabiting the Forest were regarded as a brave and skilful race, not merely
in their own <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>quarter of the kingdom, but also in the camp of its Kings.&nbsp;
They were skilful with the bow from following the chase on the King&rsquo;s
behalf, and were of course able sappers and miners from the nature of their
everyday occupations.&nbsp; Indeed, the tradition now in vogue amongst the
Foresters, is, that their ancestors were made free miners in return for the
aforesaid services; but it has been shown that the franchises of the mine
date from an earlier period. <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>The researches of the Rev. T. D. Fosbroke, as printed in his History of
the county, supply most of the following additional particulars of this
reign.&nbsp; The Bishop of Llandaff, who already claimed the moiety of a
fishery at Bigswear on the Wye, to which the parish of Newland extends,
received a grant of the newly cleared Forest lands for founding a chantry
at the latter place.&nbsp; Tithes to the amount of ten pounds from the
iron-mines in the Forest were given to that dignitary, but the Dean of
Hereford and the Canons, with the Rectors of St. Briavel&rsquo;s and
Lydney, aided by their servants and others, violently carried them away,
the see of Hereford then comprising all these parts.&nbsp; The vineyard of
Norton, together with certain wastes, were let to John de Witham and his
heir for 50s. 6d. per annum, provided two hundred acres of the adjoining
soil were brought into cultivation and enclosed at a certain rent, by which
all injury to the Crown would be avoided, Norton not being a vineyard, but
a &ldquo;lacius&rdquo; worth sixpence per annum.&nbsp; So also William Jote
might hold one hundred acres, twenty lying in Michelerleye, and eighty in
Brakenford, and also the Prior of Lanthony two hundred and seventy acres,
upon paying twopence per annum.&nbsp; The Abbot of Gloucester had leave to
cut wood in Birdewoode and Hope Mayloysell, without demand or view of the
Forester.&nbsp; The men of Rodley Mead Forest were allowed to have firewood
and mast for their swine.&nbsp; John de Abbenhall held a certain bailiwick
of the King by the service of guarding it with bows and arrows.&nbsp;
Robert de Barrington held forty <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>acres of waste near Malescoyte-wood.&nbsp;
Ralph Hatheway was seized of forty acres in Holstone.&nbsp; Bogo de
Knoville was seized of Kilcot-wood, and Henry de Chaworth had a forge in
the Forest.</p>
<p>By the sixth year of Edward III. (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1333)
the dispute between the Dean and Chapter of Hereford and the Bishop of
Llandaff, relative to the tithes of the iron-mines in the parish of
Newland, was settled in the Bishop&rsquo;s favour, who also obtained the
great tithes and the presentation to the living, all of which still
continue attached to that see, and in connexion with which it may be
observed, that by far the larger part of the fabric of the church at
Newland exhibits the style of architecture which prevailed at that
period.&nbsp; It is a large building, and the tower is particularly
fine.</p>
<p>Parliament now confirmed the perambulations made in 26th and 28th Edward
I., which reduced the bounds of the Forest to the limits which, with some
slight exceptions, remained in force till within the last twenty-five
years.&nbsp; The ensuing items of information, taken from Mr.
Fosbroke&rsquo;s valuable work on the county, apply to this period.&nbsp;
Guy de Brien, to whom the Forest was farmed, obtained wages from the Crown
for the payment of four foresters, who were allowed the privilege of
cutting all underwood within the same from seven years to seven
years.&nbsp; J. Flory held the bailiwick of the Lee, and John Preston that
of Blakeney.&nbsp; Robert Sappy, warden of the Forest, petitioned
Parliament for some allowance to be made him, as, owing to the late
alienations of Crown property in favour of the monks of Tintern and the
Bishop of Llandaff, he no longer received the usual pay of one hundred
shillings per annum.&nbsp; The Abbey of Gloucester had twigs granted to it
for the annual repairs of the weirs at Minsterworth and Durry; a similar
privilege was enjoyed by the lords of the manor of Rodley, provided the
twigs were fetched once a day with two horses, between the 14th of
September and the 3rd of May; heavy timber was also allowed for the same
purpose.&nbsp; John Juge succeeded to the bailiwick of the Lee, but was
unlawfully deprived <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>of it by John Talbot, who held the castle on
Penyard as well as Goodrich.&nbsp; William de Staunton held the bailiwick
there, and Reginald Abbenhall the woods.&nbsp; Walter Ivor held that at
Blakeney, after Roger Flotman.&nbsp; The Abbot of Gloucester had ninety
acres of land in Walmore, at eight pence an acre rent, for cultivation, but
not for commonage.&nbsp; John Joice and his heirs had a grant of 116 acres
in several parcels in the Forest, at the yearly rent of nineteen shillings
and four pence.</p>
<p>In the reign of Richard II. John Wolton obtained the grant for life of a
place called Stowe.&nbsp; It was found that a monk from the convent of
Grace Dieu was celebrating mass in the Forest for the souls of the King,
his successors, and ancestors, holding two carucates of land, ten acres of
meadow, and six acres of wood, a fact which may account for the name of
&ldquo;Church Hill,&rdquo; at Park End.&nbsp; Thomas Hatheway was a chief
forester.&nbsp; A bailiwick in the Forest, with lands in Lee-Walton and Lee
in Herefordshire, were held in tail, remainder to Richard Curle, by Thomas
de Brugg and Elizabeth his wife.&nbsp; The Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s
and the Forest were given in special tail to the Duke of Gloucester, who
was afterwards empowered by Parliament to constitute justices and other
officers then usually attached to such properties.</p>
<p>In the time of Henry IV. William Warwyn held a certain bailiwick here by
the service of being a forester in fee.&nbsp; Another office called
&ldquo;the forester&rsquo;s wyke&rdquo; was filled by Henry de Aure.&nbsp;
In the succeeding reign this Forest was held in capite as the King&rsquo;s
heir, by John Duke of Bedford, under a grant made by Henry IV.</p>
<p>Whilst the throne was occupied by Henry VI. we have chiefly to notice
the complaint, which the traders of Tewkesbury made to the Government, that
&ldquo;their boats and trowes conveying all manner of merchandise down the
Severn to Bristol, &amp;c.,&rdquo; had been stopped at the coast of the
Forest by great multitudes of the common people dwelling thereabouts, who
seized their vessels, carried away the corn, threatened their lives if they
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>resisted, and forbad any complaint being made, on their coming
that way again.&nbsp; The petition caused letters of privy seal to be
proclaimed in those parts to the effect that &ldquo;no man of the said
Forest should be so hardy to inquiet or disturb the people passing the said
river with merchandise, upon pain of treason.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the account
proceeds to say that &ldquo;the said trespassers came to the said river
with greater routs and riots than ever they did before, there despoiling at
divers times eight trowes of wheat, rye, flour, and divers other goods and
chattels, and the men of the same cast overboard, and divers of them
drowned, and the hawsers of the same trowes cut away, and mainstrung the
owners of the said goods, who should not be so hardy as to cause any manner
of victuals to be carried any more by the same stream, much or little, for
lord or for lady, as they would hew their boats all to pieces if they did
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; More stringent measures were therefore evidently
necessary, and in 1429 the Parliament passed an act, enforcing a
restoration of the plunder, and amends for the injury done, within fifteen
days, and the offenders to be imprisoned, or else the Statute of Winchester
would be enforced against them.</p>
<p>The singular perquisite of a bushel of coal, worth twenty pence, from
each pit, at the end of every six weeks, was now attached to the office of
&ldquo;capital forester of all the foresters,&rdquo; held at this period by
Robert Greyndour.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s lands, manors, castles, and other
possessions in this Forest, were also granted to Henry Duke of Warwick, for
one hundred pounds annual rental.</p>
<p>After the accession of Edward IV., and his unpopular marriage with
Elizabeth Woodville, this Forest was the spot to which, upon the defeat at
Edgecote (26th July, 1469), her father the Earl Rivers and her brother Sir
John Woodville fled, where they were recaptured and carried to Northampton,
their place of execution.&nbsp; A sergeantry, called woodward of the Lee
Baile, was then held by John Throckmorton, Esq.</p>
<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. the office of Bleysbale and forestership of
fee was filled by William Alberton.&nbsp; <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>A rental of sixty-five
shillings and sixpence was paid to the Crown for certain lands in the
Forest held by the priory of Monmouth; and others, called Cley-pitts,
Litterfield, and Hill Hardwell, paid two shillings and four pence.&nbsp;
Letters patent granted the custody of the Gablewood to Henry Bream.</p>
<p>Edward VI. farmed the Forest to Sir Anthony Kingston.&nbsp; How far the
Forest population were interested in the stirring events of the
Reformation, we are, unfortunately, left to conjecture; but the suppression
of the adjacent Abbeys of Tintern and Flaxley, with their large
possessions, must have brought the changes of the period visibly home to
them.</p>
<p>The reign of Elizabeth brings us to the date of an incident more
generally notorious perhaps than any other in the history of Dean Forest,
viz. its intended destruction by the Spanish Armada.&nbsp; Evelyn in his
&lsquo;Sylva&rsquo; thus mentions it:&mdash;&ldquo;I have heard that in the
great expedition of 1588 it was expressly enjoined the Spanish Armada that
if, when landed, they should not be able to subdue our nation and make good
their conquest, they should yet be sure not to leave a tree standing in the
Forest of Dean.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were it not that he particularly states that
he had &ldquo;heard&rdquo; the report, we should conclude that he obtained
his information from Fuller&rsquo;s &lsquo;Worthies,&rsquo; published two
years previously, where it is mentioned with this only difference, that
&ldquo;a Spanish ambassador was to get it done by private practices and
cunning contrivances.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fuller had probably read this account in
&lsquo;Samuel Hartlib, his Legacy of Husbandry,&rsquo; published in 1655,
where, speaking of the deficiency of woods at that time, he
writes&mdash;&ldquo;the State hath done very well to pull down divers
iron-works in the Forest of Dean, that the timber might be preserved for
shipping, which is accounted the toughest in England, and, when it is dry,
as hard as iron.&nbsp; The common people did use to say that in Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s days the Spaniards sent an ambassador purposely to get
this wood destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Evelyn writes that he &ldquo;heard&rdquo; what he states <!--
page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>of the
matter, Mr. Secretary Pepys was probably his informant, who was told it by
his friend Sir John Winter, who again heard it from his grandfather, Sir
William Winter, vice-admiral of Elizabeth&rsquo;s fleet, but kinsman to
Thomas Winter of Huddington, who at the close of this reign was constantly
aiding the Spanish Romanists in their intrigues here, and eventually took
part in the Gunpowder Plot.&nbsp; Such tradition is highly to the credit of
the Forest timber of those days, if not to the iron as well.&nbsp; Both
must have been renowned for supplying an important portion of the materials
used in the Royal dockyards, which were at this time much enlarged, an
increase of the navy being found necessary; whilst the stock of timber then
standing in different parts of the kingdom was judged so insufficient for
the wants of the Government, that recent acts of the legislature had
directed that &ldquo;twelve standils or storers likely to become timber
should be left on every acre of wood or underwood that was felled at or
under twenty-four years&rsquo; growth,&rdquo; and prohibited the
&ldquo;turning woodland into tillage,&rdquo; and required that,
&ldquo;whenever any wood was cut, it must be immediately enclosed, and the
young spring thereof protected for seven years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, no
trees upwards of a foot in the square were to be converted into charcoal
for making iron.</p>
<p>The returns from Sir Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s collection preserved in
the Lansdowne MSS. recognise the above regulations, as well as the market
for wood created by the Forest iron-works, now greatly enlarged; they
possess considerable interest, and will be found in Appendix No. I.</p>

licence confirmed.</p>
<p>On the 17th of February, 1612, William Earl of Pembroke obtained a grant
&ldquo;of 12,000 cords of wood yearly for twenty-one years at 4s. per cord,
being &pound;2400, and reserving a rent besides of &pound;33 6s. 8d. per
annum,&rdquo; with &ldquo;liberty to dig for and take within any part of
the said Forest, or the precincts thereof, such and so much mine ore,
cinders, earth, sand, stone, breaks, moss, sea coal, and marle, as should
be necessary for carrying on the iron-works let to him, or which he should
erect; no person or persons whatsoever other than the said Earl to be
permitted during the said term to take or carry out of the said Forest any
wood, timber, mine ore, or cinders, without consent of the said Earl,
except such timber as should be used for his Majesty&rsquo;s
shipping.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl obtained, on the 13th June of the same
year, a grant of &ldquo;the lordship, manor, town, and castle of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s, and all the Forest of Dean with the appurtenances, and all
lands, mines, and quarries belonging thereto, except all great trees, <!--
page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>wood, and
underwood, to hold for forty years at the yearly rent of &pound;83 18s.
4d., and an increase rent of &pound;3 8d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears that, soon after these leases were granted, the miners,
hitherto accustomed to dig for ore in the Forest, resumed their work
without the Earl&rsquo;s consent, and an information was filed against some
of them by the Attorney-General.&nbsp; Upon this, an order, dated 28th
January, 1613, was made by the Court, &ldquo;that those miners, and such
others as had been accustomed to dig ore in the Forest, upon the humble
submission for their offences, and acknowledgment that the soil was the
King&rsquo;s, and that they had no interest therein, and upon their motion
by counsel that they were poor, and had no other means of support, and
praying to be continued in their employment, should be permitted, <i>out of
charity and grace</i>, <i>and not of right</i>, to dig for mine ore and
cinders, to be carried to his Majesty&rsquo;s iron-works, and not to any
other place, at the accustomed rates; if the farmers of the King&rsquo;s
iron-works should refuse to give those rates which, as well as the number
of diggers, were to be ascertained by Commissioners to be named by the
Court, that then they might sell the ore to others; but no new diggers were
to be allowed, but only such poor men as were inhabitants of the said
Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not intended that this order should always
continue in force, but only until such time as the cause brought in the
name of the foresters should be heard and determined.&nbsp; This, however,
appears never to have been done, as no decree was obtained, probably from
the miners considering it best to accept the terms offered, regarding the
above order as a record in their favour, since it provided that &ldquo;no
new diggers were to be allowed, but only such poor men as were inhabitants
of the said Forest;&rdquo; a view, it may be remarked, agreeing with that
which the free miners took in their memorial of 1833. <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>The cinders adverted to were the ashes or refuse left by a former race
of iron manufacturers, whose skill <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>was too limited to
effect more than the separation of a portion of the metal, but which the
improved methods, now introduced into the district, turned to a good
account.&nbsp; A return made in 1617, by Sir William Coke, &amp;c., to a
commission issued out of the Exchequer, to inquire concerning the Forest of
Dean, states that &ldquo;His Majesty, since the erecting the iron-works,
had received a greater revenue than formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their structure
is described in &ldquo;The Booke of Survey of the Forest of Dean
Ironwork,&rdquo; dated 1635, from which it appears that the stone body of
the furnace now adopted was usually about twenty-two feet square, the blast
being kept up by a water-wheel not less than twenty-two feet in diameter,
acting upon two pairs of bellows measuring eighteen feet by four, and kept
in blast for several months together.&nbsp; Such structures existed at
Cannope, Park End, Sowdley, and Lydbrook.&nbsp; Besides which, there were
forges, comprising chafferies and fineries, at Park End, Whitecroft,
Bradley, Sowdley, and Lydbrook.&nbsp; Messrs. Harris and Chaloner, &amp;c.,
as farmers to the Crown, held all of them on lease.</p>
<p>The last justice seat in Eyre, or Supreme Court of Judicature for the
royal forests, was held the same year as the above (1635) at Gloucester
Castle before Henry Earl of Holland, on which occasion &ldquo;the matter
concerning the perambulation of this Forest was solemnly debated,&rdquo;
the counsel for the Crown producing the bounds thereof as settled by the
12th of Henry III. and 10th Edward I., with the view of obtaining its
re-extension to Gloucester, Monmouth, and Chepstow.&nbsp; On the other
hand, the counsel for the City of Gloucester, &amp;c., brought forward the
perambulations made 26th and 28th Edward I., confirmed by Letters Patent
29th Edward I., and by an Act of 10th Edward III.&nbsp; The Grand Jury, not
being able to agree to their verdict on that day, which was a Saturday,
desired further time in a matter of such weight; and on the Monday
following decided, that the more extensive limits, comprising seventeen
additional villages, were the true ones.&nbsp; But &ldquo;their inhabitants
being fearful that they would be <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>questioned for many things done contrary to the
Forest Laws, the King&rsquo;s Counsel, in regard of their being but new
brought in, and long usage, thought it not fitt to proceed with any of them
at that justice seat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amongst some 120 claims to rights and
privileges of various kinds preserved in the Office of Public Records, <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a> and
put in at the same Court, was one of Philip Earl of Pembroke to be
Constable of the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s and Warden of the Forest,
under a grant from the King, and, as such, Chief Judge of the Mine Law
Court.</p>
<p>In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1637 a grant was made to Edward
Terringham of &ldquo;all the mines of coal and quarries of grindstone
within the Forest of Dean, and in all places within the limits and
perambulations thereof, as well those within his Majesty&rsquo;s demesne
lands, and the waste and soil there, as also all such as lay within the
lands of any of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects within the perambulation of
the said Forest, to his Majesty reserved, or lawfully belonging, to hold
for thirty-one years, at the yearly rent of &pound;30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next year (1638) is marked by the first effort which the Crown seems
to have made to renew the crops of timber in the Forest, rendered necessary
by the report that, on surveying it, a supply of no more than 105,557
trees, containing 61,928 tons of timber, and 153,209 cords of wood, of
which only 14,350 loads were fit for shipbuilding, was found, as &ldquo;the
trees were generally decayed, and passed their full groath.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly, under the direction of Sir Baynham Throckmorton, 16,000 or
17,000 acres were ordered to be taken in, &ldquo;leaving fit and convenient
highways in and through the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; After sundry meetings, the
commoners consented thereunto, few or none objecting, in consideration of
4000 acres set apart for their use on the different sides of the Forest, as
follows:&mdash;On the side next Lydney and Awre, 550 acres; towards
Ruerdean and Lydbrook, 350 acres; near to St. Briavel&rsquo;s, 500 acres;
towards Little Dean, Flaxley, Abenhall, and Mitcheldean, <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>and the Lea, 876 acres;
in Abbot&rsquo;s Wood, 76 acres; on the side nearest to Newland and the
villages of Breme, Clearwell, and Coleford, 900 acres; towards Newland, 174
acres; next to Bicknor, 350 acres; and towards Rodley and Northwood, 100
acres.&nbsp; The Lea Bailey, containing the best timber, was not included,
but left open.&nbsp; The proportion observed in the size of these common
lands is probably indicative of the way in which the population surrounding
the Forest was distributed.&nbsp; Traces of the bounds of some of these
allotments may yet be made out, by the remains of the ditches and banks
with which they were fenced.</p>
<p>Such a scheme, if judiciously carried out, would have done much to
secure the object in view, only it was connected unhappily with the entire
sale made under the date of 20th February, 1640 (15th Charles I.), to Sir
John Winter, of all the mines, minerals, and stone-quarries within the
limits of the Forest, to work and use the same, together with all timber,
trees, woods, underwood growing in any part thereof, in consideration of
&pound;10,000, and the yearly sum of &pound;16,000 for six years, and of a
fee farm rent of &pound;1950 12s. 6d. for ever.&nbsp; This bargain was
equivalent to selling the Forest altogether, and the inhabitants of the
district, being greatly dissatisfied, took advantage of the approaching
civil distractions to throw down the fences which Sir J. Winter had already
begun to make.</p>
<p>Of those distractions, the first that occurred in this part of the
county took place on the 20th February, 1643.&nbsp; Clarendon and Corbet
record, that on this day Lord Herbert, the Earl of Worcester&rsquo;s eldest
son, and the King&rsquo;s Lieutenant-General of South Wales, marched
through Coleford and the Forest of Dean for Gloucester, at the head of an
army of 500 horse and 1500 foot, the outfit and preparation of which is
stated to have cost &pound;60,000.&nbsp; At Coleford their progress was
impeded by a troop of Parliamentarians under Colonel Berrowe, aided by a
disorderly rabble of country people.&nbsp; An affray ensued, during which
the old market-house was burnt, and Major-General Lawley, who commanded the
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>foot,
&ldquo;a bold and sprightly man,&rdquo; with two other officers, were shot
dead from a window, although not one common soldier was hurt.&nbsp; Colonel
Brett was then put in command of the foot, Lord John Somerset continuing at
the head of the horse.&nbsp; They forced a passage through, after capturing
Lieutenant-Colonel Winter, together with some inferior officers and common
soldiers, and so, putting the rest to flight, marched without further
molestation for Gloucester.</p>
<p>In the April following, Sir William Waller, retreating from Monmouth
towards Gloucester through the Forest, narrowly escaped capture by Prince
Maurice, who was at hand to intercept him with a considerable force.&nbsp;
Alluding many years afterwards to this adventure, he
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;Upon my march that night through the Forest of Dean,
it happened through the sleepiness of an officer, that the main body was
separated from the fore troope with which I marched, so that I was fain to
make an halt for above half an hour, within little more than a mile of the
Prince&rsquo;s head-quarter, in broad daylight; the allarme taken, and not
120 horse with me.&nbsp; Nevertheless, itt pleased God in his infinite
mercy to direct the rest of my troopes to me; and, under the conduct of his
providence, to grant me a safe and honorable retreat to Gloucester, in
despight of the enemy, who charged me in the reare, with more loss to
himself than to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the individual who figured most prominently in these parts at this
eventful period was the ardent royalist Sir John Winter.&nbsp; His case is
thus quaintly stated by Sanderson:&mdash;&ldquo;From the pen, as secretary
to the Queen, he was put to the pike, and did his business very handsomely,
for which he found the enmity of the Parliament ever after;&rdquo; so that
Corbet, one of their devoted adherents, designates him &ldquo;a
plague,&rdquo; and his house of White Cross, near Lydney, &ldquo;a
den.&rdquo;&nbsp; This place he had been secretly strengthening against
attack for some time, storing it with arms and ammunition, and collecting
soldiers; but he did not openly declare himself until the siege of
Gloucester was raised, <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>on 5th September, 1643.&nbsp; During the
ensuing winter, and on to the 7th of May following, Corbet speaks of him as
&ldquo;referring all his industry to his own house,&rdquo; described as
being &ldquo;in the heart of the Forest,&rdquo; of which, says the same
writer, he had &ldquo;obtained the entire command,&rdquo; and from whence
he succeeded in making constant attacks upon the adjoining small
Parliamentary garrisons of Huntley and Westbury, who were treacherously
sold to him by Captain Thomas Davis, and he was thus enabled to advance
almost to Gloucester.&nbsp; Upon the day just named, in the year 1644, the
following affray happened at Westbury, occasioned by Colonel Massy&rsquo;s
attempt to recover it for the Parliament.&nbsp; Corbet
says:&mdash;&ldquo;Here the enemy held the church, and a strong
house&rdquo; (understood to be Mr. Colchester&rsquo;s)
&ldquo;adjoining.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Governor (Colonel Massy),
observing a place not flanked, fell-up that way with the forlorne hope, and
secured them from the danger of shot.&nbsp; The men got stooles and ladders
to the windowes, where they stood safe, cast in granadoes, and fired them
out of the church.&nbsp; Having gained the church, he quickly beat them out
of their workes, and possest himself of the house, where he took about four
score prisoners, slaying twenty others, without the losse of a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the same day a similar but more fatal encounter took place at
Littledean, a village situated under the east slopes of the Forest hills,
and as yet occupied for the King.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Corbet,
&ldquo;the governor&rsquo;s troop of horse found the enemy stragling in the
towne, and, upon the discovery of their approach, shuffling towards the
garrison, which the troopers observing, alighted and ran together with them
into the house, where they tooke about 20 men.&nbsp; Neere unto which
guard, Lieutenant-Colonel Congrave, Governor of Newnham, and one Captain
Wigmore, with a few private souldiers, were surrounded in some houses by
the residue of our horse.&nbsp; These had accepted quarter, ready to render
themselves, when one of their company from the house kils a trooper, which
so enraged the rest, that <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>they broke in upon them, and put them all to
the sword: in which accident, this passage was not to be forgotten that
expressed in one place an extreame contrariety in the spirits of men under
the stroke of death: Congrave died with these words, &lsquo;Lord receive my
soule!&rsquo; and Wigmore cryed nothing but &lsquo;Dam me more, dam me
more!&rsquo; desperately requiring the last stroke, as enraged at divine
revenge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The spot where these officers fell is considered to
have been at Dean Hall, in the dining-room, near the fireplace.</p>
<p>Corbet next goes on to recite how Colonel Massy followed up these
exploits by marching to Newnham the next day, &ldquo;where,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;a strong party of Sir John Winter&rsquo;s forces kept garrison in
the church, and the fort adjoining,&rdquo; (on a spot which has been turned
lately into public pleasure grounds,) &ldquo;of considerable strength, who
at that instant were much daunted and distracted by the losse of Congrave,
their governor.&nbsp; Our men were possest of the town without opposition,
and recovered the houses, by which they got nere the workes.&nbsp; The
Governour (Massy) commanded a blind of faggots to be made athwart the
street, drew up two pieces of ordnance within pistoll shot, and observing a
place not well flanked where he might lead up his men to the best
advantage, himself marched before them, and found that part of the work
fortified with double pallisadoes; the souldiers being provided with sawes
to cut them down, and having drawn them close within a dead angle, and
secure from their shot, and drawing the rest of his forces for a storme,
the enemy forthwith desires a parley, and to speake with the governour,
which he refused, and commanded a sudden surrender.&nbsp; In this interim
some of the enemy jumpt over the workes, and so our men broke in upon the
rest, who ranne from the out worke into the churche, hoping to cleare the
mount which we had gained.&nbsp; But our men were too nimble, who had no
sooner entred the mount, but rushed upon them before they could reach home,
and <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>tumbled into the church altogether.&nbsp; Then they cryed for
quarter, when, in the very point of victory, a disaster was like to befall
us: a barrell of gunpowder was fired in the church, undoubtedly of set
purpose, and was conceived to be done by one Tipper, a most virulent
Papist, and Sir John Winter&rsquo;s servant, despairing withall of his
redemption, being a prisoner before, and having falsified his
engagement.&nbsp; The powder-blast blew many out of the church, and sorely
singed a greater number, but killed none.&nbsp; The souldiers, enraged,
fell upon them, and in the heate of blood slew neere 20, and amongst others
this Tipper.&nbsp; All the rest had quarter for their lives (save one
Captaine Butler, an Irish rebell, who was knocked down by a common
souldier), and an 100 prisoners taken.&nbsp; The service was performed
without the losse of a man on our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emboldened to proceed, and anxious to take advantage of Sir John
Winter&rsquo;s absence at Coleford, Colonel Massy marched on forthwith to
Lydney House.&nbsp; He did not attack it, however, so well was it fortified
and provided, and courageously defended, by Lady Winter, who, upon being
pressed to deliver, answered&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;Mr. Winter&rsquo;s unalterable allegiance to his King
and Sovereign, and his particular interest to this place, hath by his
Majesty&rsquo;s commission put it into this condition, which cannot be
pernicious to any but to such as oppose the one and invade the other;
wherefore rest assured that in these relations we are, by God&rsquo;s
assistance, resolved to maintain it, all extremities notwithstanding.&nbsp;
Thus much in Mr. Winter&rsquo;s absence you shall receive from</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mary
Winter</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To inconvenience so daring a lady would be contrary to the
Colonel&rsquo;s gallantry, and he drew off to the adjoining hills towards
the Forest, the better to meet Sir John Winter and Colonel Mynne, who were
reported to be returning with a considerable strength of horse, assisted
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>by
the Lord Herbert&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp; But the Royalists not appearing,
Massy contented himself with setting fire to Sir John&rsquo;s iron-mills
and furnaces, and in the evening marched back to Gloucester.</p>
<p>Lydney House and Berkeley Castle remained the last strongholds of the
Royalists in the county of Gloucester.&nbsp; The restless proprietor of the
former was perpetually engaged in attempts to restore the King&rsquo;s
declining cause, and in particular to reduce the inhabitants of the Forest,
which was an object of some importance, as their iron-works, &amp;c.,
afforded supplies to Bristol, then besieged by the Parliament forces.&nbsp;
The foresters had declined in their loyalty, through Sir John
Winter&rsquo;s occupying their woods, from which his enclosures excluded
them.&nbsp; Accordingly his name is rarely absent from the accounts given
by contemporary writers, of efforts made in this neighbourhood for the
Crown.&nbsp; Most likely he assisted Prince Rupert in his first attempt
made in the month of September, 1644, to fortify and establish a permanent
guard on the promontory at Beachley, but from which they were quickly
dislodged by Massy.&nbsp; We know he was present when the same effort was
renewed a month later, and had a second time to be relinquished, Sir John
Winter only effecting his escape by hard riding, and making a desperate
descent upon the river Wye, by which he was only just enabled to reach the
Prince&rsquo;s ships lying at its mouth.</p>
<p>So favourable an opportunity as this defeat gave for the capture of
Lydney House was not to be lost, and it was invested forthwith.&nbsp;
Timely aid was however rendered about the 2nd of April, 1645, by the
arrival of Prince Maurice with a force of 2,000 horse and 1,500 foot, who,
as they marched towards it from Hereford, took advantage of the occasion to
lay waste the Forest, as a retribution on the inhabitants for having
deserted the King&rsquo;s cause.&nbsp; Corbet says that &ldquo;they
plundered the houses to the bare walls, driving all the cattell, seizing
upon the persons of men, and sending them captives to Monmouth and
Chepstow, except such as escaped to us by <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>flight, as many did
with their armes, and some few that saved themselves in woods and mine
pitts.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same authority adds that &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s
forces returned a second time into the Forest, and took the gleanings of
the former harvest.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of the month of May the
royalists retired, and Sir John Winter, resolving that his house should
never harbour his enemies, burnt it to the ground.&nbsp; He then joined the
King, by whom he was presently despatched with letters to the Queen, in
France, and mentioning him in these terms&mdash;&ldquo;This bearer, Sir
John Winter, as thy knowledge of him makes it needlesse to recommend him to
thee, soe I should injure him if I did not beare him the true witnesse of
having served me with as much fidelity and courage as any, not without much
good successe; though some crosse accydents of late hath made him (not
without reason) desire to waite upon thee, it being needfull that I should
give him this testimony, least his journey to thee be
misinterpreted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The estate which Sir John Winter thus vacated in this neighbourhood was
soon after assigned to his opponent by the House of Commons, who ordered on
the 29th of September, 1645, &ldquo;that Major-General Massy, in
consideration of his good and faithful service which he hath done for the
kingdom, shall have allowed him the estate of Sir John Winter (who is a
delinquent to the Parliament) in the Forest of Dean; all his iron-mills,
and the woods (timber trees only excepted not to be felled), with all the
profits belonging to them; and ordered that an order at once should be
brought into the House to that purpose.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eventually, however,
Sir John Winter recovered his property, through the influence probably of
the Lords in Parliament, who appear to have favoured him.&nbsp; On his
return to this country he nevertheless seems to have been imprisoned, for
on the 7th of September, 1652, we find him liberated from the Tower, upon
bail for three months, on account of sickness; a term of liberty which was
enlarged upon the 7th of December, on the same security, <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to three months longer,
with permission to go where he pleased within twenty miles of London.&nbsp;
On the 17th of the same month he was remanded back to the Tower.</p>
<p>Evelyn tells us that at this time Sir John Winter amused himself with a
project for charring coal.&nbsp; &ldquo;July 11th, 1656.&mdash;Came home by
Greenwich Ferry, where I saw Sir John Winter&rsquo;s new project of
charring sea-coale, to burne out the sulphure and render it sweete.&nbsp;
He did it by burning the coals in such earthen pots as the glasse-men mealt
their mettal, so firing them without consuming them, using a barr of yron
in each crucible or pot, which barr has a hook at one end, that so the
coales being mealted in a furnace w<sup>th</sup> other crude sea-coales
under them, may be drawn out of the potts sticking to the yron, whence they
are beaten off in greate halfe-exhausted cinders, which being rekindled
make a cleare pleasant chamber fire, deprived of their sulphur and arsenic
malignity.&nbsp; What successe it may have, time will discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverting to Sir John Winter&rsquo;s retreat from Lydney, it may be
remarked that, with his retirement from the Forest district, its south side
became quiet; not so its north, for there the following incidents
occurred.&nbsp; The first of them arose from Colonel Massy&rsquo;s efforts
to retake Monmouth, which he strove to accomplish by feigning a sudden
retreat from before it towards Gloucester, as though he had received
unfavourable tidings.&nbsp; With this view he and his forces drew off some
three miles into the thickets of the Forest, sending out scouts at the same
time to prevent his being surprised by the enemy.&nbsp; Intelligence of
their disappearance being reported within the garrison to
Lieutenant-Colonel Kyrle, who was in the secret, he speedily set out in
pursuit, but was himself surprised with a troop of thirty horse, near
midnight, by Massy, in Mr. Hall&rsquo;s house, at High-Meadow.&nbsp; A
combination of their forces being effected, they returned to Monmouth, and
with mutual aid, favoured by a dark and rainy night, recaptured <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the town, much
to the joy of the Colonel and his friends.&nbsp; Kyrle, an ancestor of
&ldquo;the Man of Ross,&rdquo; lived at Walford, where he was buried, and
where his helmet is still preserved.</p>
<p>The capture of Monmouth proved to be only temporary, as the place was
again lost, thus exposing that side of the Forest to the incursions of the
Cavalier troops.&nbsp; To check these invasions, the garrison of
High-Meadow was carefully kept up.&nbsp; Ruerdean, six miles to the west,
and well situated for guarding the Forest on the north, was made another
military post, being intended to stop plunderers from the King&rsquo;s
garrison at Goodrich, and where there is a spot yet called
&ldquo;Shoot-Hill,&rdquo; adjoining which many cannon-balls have been
found.&nbsp; Probably the site of the old castle at Bicknor was also
converted into an out-station, guarding the two parallel valleys which
there pass up towards the middle of the Forest from the Wye.&nbsp; This
station would likewise assist, from its relative position, in transmitting
signals between Ruerdean and High-Meadow, or even from Gloucester, if the
Beacon, which formerly stood on the crest of Edge Hill, were included in
the range.&nbsp; Such posts would be serviceable to the Parliamentary
Colonel Birch, when engaged in the siege of Goodrich Castle, not more than
four miles north of Ruerdean; for his supplies would be drawn chiefly from
the Forest, as indeed appears from a letter dated 4th July, 1646, in which
he says, &ldquo;We have supplies of shells for our granadoes from the
Forest of Dean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several traditions of violence and blood, referring no doubt to this
period, are preserved by the inhabitants of these parts of the Forest, one
of whom reports an act of cruelty perpetrated on a householder living in
the little hamlet of Drybrook, who was struck down, and his eyes knocked
out, for refusing to give up a flitch of bacon to a foraging party.&nbsp;
Another legend, relative to the same neighbourhood, preserves the memory of
a skirmish called &ldquo;Edge Hill&rsquo;s Fight,&rdquo; from the spot on
which it occurred.&nbsp; It is true that some of the neighbouring foresters
suppose it to be &ldquo;the <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Great Fight mentioned in the almanack,&rdquo;
an idea which might perhaps have given rise to the story, were it not that
a small stream which descends from the place in question bears the name of
&ldquo;Gore Brook,&rdquo; from the human blood which on that occasion
stained its waters.</p>
<p>The ensuing years of the Protectorate, judging from the frequent notices
in the Parliamentary Journals to that effect, appear to have been
destructive to the timber of the Forest rather than to life or
property.&nbsp; Frequent orders were issued by the Committee of the House
of Commons charged with the care of the Forest of Dean, forbidding the
felling of any more trees whatever, and ordering that any which had been
cut down should be sold for the benefit of the Government.&nbsp; The
gentlemen of the county were invited to assist herein, both by viewing any
timber which had been felled, and also by causing any of it which they
judged fit to be reserved for shipping to be brought into the stores of the
Navy.&nbsp; Sir J. Winter asserts that during the time of the Commonwealth
above 40,000 trees were cut down by order of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>In 1650 the above-named Committee ordered all the iron-works to be
suppressed and demolished.&nbsp; Six years later a Bill was brought in and
passed, signed by the Protector Richard, for mitigating the rigour of the
Forest Laws, and for preserving the timber, which all contemporary
testimony on the subject states to have gone miserably to wreck during the
civil wars.&nbsp; On the 11th of May, 1659, Colonel White reported to the
House of Commons, that &ldquo;upon the 3rd day of this instant month divers
rude people in tumultuous way, in the Forest of Dean, did break down the
fences, and cut and carry away the gates of certain coppices enclosed for
preservation of timber, turned in their cattle, and set divers places of
the said Forest on fire, to the great destruction of the young growing
wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; This riot was probably excited by the efforts which the
Government had recently made for the re-afforesting of 18,000 acres; to
effect which 400 cabins of poor people, <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>living upon the waste,
and destroying the wood and timber, were thrown down.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know what was the disposition of the
inhabitants of the Forest, and of the neighbourhood generally, towards the
exiled Sovereign, as the way to his restoration began to open out.&nbsp; A
slight clue is afforded by Captain Titus&rsquo;s letter, reporting to the
King that &ldquo;he had been in the Forest of Dean, and had found the
gentlemen very forward; that several of them had engaged for considerable
numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The return of Charles at once restored Sir John Winter to liberty, and
to the benefits of the Patent which the late King had granted him, as also
to his place as Secretary and Chancellor to the Queen Dowager.&nbsp; He
proceeded to act upon the former, by repairing his enclosures, in spite of
determined opposition from the neighbouring inhabitants, who strongly
represented to the Government that the continuance of that grant would
injure both it and the public.&nbsp; Sir Charles Harbord, under date 28th
of December, 1661, thus describes the way in which the above complaint was
preferred:&mdash;&ldquo;His Majesty hath been pleased to be present with my
Lord Chancellor, and Lord Treasurer, &amp;c., at the hearing of this
business, and hath given order that a Commission shall be forthwith issued
out of the Exchequer to inquire into the state of the Forest; intending,
upon the return of the said Commission, to acquaint the Parliament with the
true state of the business; and to recommend it to their wisdom to provide
that the said Forest may be restored to his Majesty&rsquo;s demesne, and
re-afforested, and improved by enclosures for a future supply of wood for a
constant support of the iron-works there, producing the best iron of Europe
for many years, and for the produce of timber for the navy, and other uses
in time to come; which might be of great use for defence of this nation,
the old trees there standing being above 300 years&rsquo; growth, and yet
as good timber as any in the world; and the ground so apt to produce, and
so strong to preserve timber, especially <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>oaks, that within 100
years there may be sufficient provision there found to maintain the navy
royal for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the ancient trees here named are those
of which Sir John Winter spoke in the &ldquo;good discourse&rdquo; Mr.
Pepys had with him, as &ldquo;being left at a great fall in Edward the
Third&rsquo;s time, by the name of forbid-trees, which at this day are
called &lsquo;vorbid trees.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here it may be noted, that there happened on the night of 18th February,
1662, a dreadful storm of wind, alluding to which Pepys
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;We have letters from the Forest of Deane, that above
1,000 oakes and as many beeches are blown down in one walke there;&rdquo;
and Mr. Fosbroke has recorded from some other source, that near Newent
&ldquo;the roads were impassable till the trees blown down were cut away,
in some great orchards it being possible to go from one end to the other
without touching the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commission mentioned above was directed to Lord Herbert, as
Constable of the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s and Warden of the Forest,
and others, to examine the state and condition thereof.&nbsp; After a
careful survey, it was reported by them that they had found 25,929 oaks and
4,204 beeches, containing 121,572 cords of wood, fit for being converted
into charcoal, as used at the iron furnaces, and 11,335 tons of ship timber
suitable for the navy.&nbsp; They add, however, that &ldquo;cabins of
beggarly people, with goats, sheep, and swine, began to invade the same as
formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fresh agreement was forthwith entered into with
Sir John Winter on the part of the Crown, who thereupon surrendered his
former Patent, reserving the woods called Snead and Kidnalls, and nominated
Francis Finch and Robert Clayton to receive a new grant of all such trees
as were not fit for shipping, together with the use and occupation of the
King&rsquo;s iron-works, and liberty to dig for and use iron ore and
cinders in the Forest.&nbsp; Touching the drawing up of this agreement, Mr.
Pepys&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diary,&rsquo; under date 20th June, 1662, supplies us
with the following particulars:&mdash;&ldquo;Up by 4 or 5 o&rsquo;clock,
and to the office, <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>and there drew up the agreement between the
King and Sir John Winter about the Forest of Deane; and having done it, he
come himself, whom I observed to be a man of fine parts; and we read it,
and both liked it well.&nbsp; That done, I turned to the Forest of Deane,
in Speede&rsquo;s Mapps, and there he shewed me how it lies; and the
Lea-bayly with the great charge of carrying it to Lydney, and many other
things worth knowing.&rdquo;&nbsp; They evidently enjoyed each
other&rsquo;s society, for in the month of August next following they again
met at &ldquo;the Mitre,&rdquo; in Fenchurch Street, &ldquo;to a venison
pasty,&rdquo; whither Mr. Pepys was brought &ldquo;in Sir John
Winter&rsquo;s coach, where I found him&rdquo; (he records) &ldquo;a very
worthy man, and good discourse, most of which was concerning the Forest of
Deane, and the timber there, and iron workes with their great antiquity,
and the vast heaps of cinders which they find, and are now of great value,
being necessary for the making of iron at this day; and without which they
cannot work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evelyn&rsquo;s Diary of 5th November, 1662, also
points to the same topic:&mdash;&ldquo;The Council of the Royal Society met
to amend the Statutes, &amp;c., dined together; afterwards meeting at
Gresham College, where was a discourse suggested by me, concerning planting
his Majesty&rsquo;s Forest of Dean with oake, now so much exhausted of ye
choicest ship-timber in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Winter lost no time in acting upon the privileges conferred on
him by the late agreement; but just as on the former occasion, it gave
extreme dissatisfaction to the neighbourhood, whose complaints reached the
House of Commons, and forthwith a committee was appointed to investigate
the whole matter; from which committee Sir Charles Harbord reported to the
House, &ldquo;that Sir John Winter had 500 cutters of wood employed in Dean
Forest, and that all the timber would be destroyed if care should not be
speedily taken to prevent it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report of the committee was
accompanied by certain propositions, which manifest a public spirit highly
creditable to the neighbourhood, although <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>&ldquo;the great
difficulty&rdquo; is noticed &ldquo;with which the many freeholders that
had right of common and other privileges were prevailed with to submit the
same to the Crown for enclosing the said Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
propositions were made the basis of the ensuing Act, and I insert them
without abridgment.&nbsp; They are headed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Proposals by and on the behalf of the Freeholders, Inhabitants,
and Commoners, within the Forest of Dean, for the preservation and
improvement of the growth of timber there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imprimis, That 11,000 acres of the wastle soil of the Forest of
Dean, whereof the Lea Baily and Cannopp to be part of the said wastle, may
be enclosed by his Majesty, and discharged for ever from all manner of
pasture, estovers, and pannage; and if ever his Majesty, or his successors,
shall think fit to lay open any part of the said 11,000 acres, then to take
in so much elsewhere, so as the whole enclosure exceed not at any one time
11,000 acres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all the wood or timber which shall hereafter grow upon the
remaining 13,000 acres shall absolutely belong to his Majesty, discharged
from all estovers for ever, and pannage for twenty years next
ensuing.&nbsp; That the whole wastle soil be re-afforested, and subject to
the Forest laws; but that the severity of the Forest laws be taken off from
the lands in several, belonging to the freeholders and inhabitants within
the said Forest, they themselves being contented to serve his Majesty,
according to their several offices and places, as formerly at the Forest
courts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the deer to be kept on the said waste soil may not exceed
800 at any one time; and the fees which belong to the particular officers,
touching venison, may be preserved to them, as to venison only, and not to
wood and trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it is consented to that the winter heyning and fence month,
according to the Forest law, being <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>such times wherein no
kind of cattle be permitted to abide in any part of the said waste, may be
understood to be from Saint Martin&rsquo;s day in the winter to Saint
George&rsquo;s day in April; and afterwards, from fifteen days before
Midsummer to fifteen days after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all grants of any part of the waste soil of the said Forest
be re-assumed and made void; and that no part of the said waste or soil be
aliened for ever from the Crown, or farmed to any particular person or
persons, by lease or otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &ldquo;And that this may be settled by Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;(Signed) <span class="smcap">Hen</span>:
<span class="smcap">Hall</span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Dun</span>: <span class="smcap">Colchester</span>,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="smcap">Wm</span>. <span
class="smcap">Probin</span>.&nbsp;  <span class="smcap">Jo</span>: <span
class="smcap">Witt</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of the foregoing propositions appears from the use made
of them, more than a century afterwards, by the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests in 1788, who informed the descendants of those gentlemen who
appended their names to the above document, that they had thereby lost all
claim to any perquisite in the way of bark and windfalls; observing also,
that the important Act of 1668 (20 Charles II.) resulting from it was
approved by and obtained at the desire of the freeholders, inhabitants, and
commoners then living.</p>
<p>Another proposition intended to further the preservation of the Forest
woods was presented to the Lord Warden of the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s
by the freeholders thereof, promising on their part to relinquish claims to
wood and timber for so long a time as &ldquo;his sacred Majesty&rdquo;
should resolve to suspend his iron-works therein, whom they implore to call
in the patent granted to Sir John Winter.</p>
<p>Some idea may be formed of the strength of public feeling against Sir
John Winter, on account of his wholesale fellings of the Forest timber, by
the decision which Mr. Pepys records his &ldquo;cousin Roger&rdquo; to have
given upon him, viz. that &ldquo;he deserves to be hanged.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
order that the mischief might be put an end to as soon as possible, late as
it was in the session, a bill was brought <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>into the House for
settling the Forest, and preserving and improving the wood and
timber.&nbsp; Parliament was prorogued, however, before the bill could
pass, and its promoters had to be content with the House
&ldquo;recommending the Lord Treasurer and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
to take care for the preservation and improvement of the
Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; This recommendation appears to have had no influence
on Sir John Winter, for on a new survey made in 1667 it was reported to
Government that out of the 30,233 trees sold to him, only about 200
remained standing, and that from 7000 to 8000 tons of timber, fit for his
Majesty&rsquo;s navy, was found wanting.&nbsp; He would seem to have felt
some alarm at this report, for twice about this time he resorted to Mr.
Pepys, who writes, 15th March, 1667&mdash;&ldquo;This morning I was called
up by Sir John Winter, poor man, come in a sedan from the other end of the
town, about helping the King in the business of bringing down his timber to
the sea-side in the Forest of Deane;&rdquo; and again 30th April,
&ldquo;Sir John Winter, to discourse with me about the Forest of
Deane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the propositions sent up to the Government in 1663 were incorporated
in the Act of 20 Charles II., chap. 3, which also provided that the new
enclosures should be perfected within two years, in favourable and
convenient places, the cost of making and maintaining them being met by the
sale of such trees as would never prove timber; that no trees were to be
felled until they had been viewed and marked by two or more justices of the
peace, under a penalty of twenty pounds; that no fee-trees were to be
allowed, and all grants to be void; that every freeholder might do what he
pleased with his land; that no enclosure was to be mined, quarried, or
trespassed in; that the bounds of the Forest were to remain as settled in
20 James I.; that all lawful rights and privileges relating to its minerals
were to continue, with permission to the Crown to lease coal-mines and
stone-quarries for periods not exceeding thirty-one years; that the
letters-patent granted for a term not expired to Sir John Winter, Kt.,
Francis Finch and <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Robert Clayton, Esqs., should remain good, as
also, certain leases granted to Thomas Preston, Esq., and Sir Edward
Villiers, Kt.&nbsp; After all that had occurred, it seems strange that Sir
John Winter should have obtained permission by Act of Parliament to retain
his patent; he had however several powerful friends, and also strong claims
on the Crown in consideration of his services during the civil war.</p>

Parsons&rsquo;s account of the Forest.</p>
<p>Contemporaneously with the important Parliamentary enactments noticed in
the preceding chapter, there took place, on the 18th of March (1663), the
earliest session of a local but very significant court, that of &ldquo;the
Mine Law,&rdquo; whose date and proceedings have been preserved.&nbsp; It
was held at Clearwell before Sir Baynham Throgmorton, deputy constable of
St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, and a jury of forty-eight free miners, and
shows that the Forest Miners of that day were a body of men engaged in
carrying on their works according to rule, so as to avoid disputes or
unequal dealing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Court ordered and ordained, as respects the western half of the
district, that the minerals of the Forest could only be disposed of, beyond
the limits of the Hundred, by free miners; that no manner of carriage was
to be used for transporting them, nor more than four horses kept by any one
party; that the selling price was to be determined by six
&ldquo;Barganers&rdquo;; but that any free miner might carry &ldquo;a
dozen&rdquo; of lime coal to the lime slad for 3s., to the top of the
Little Doward for 5s. 6d., to any other kilns thereon for 5s. 4d., to the
Blackstones for 5s., to Monmouth for 5s. 6d., to the Weare over Wye for
4s., to Coldwall for 3s. 6d., to Lydbrook for 3s., and to Redbrook for 4s.
4d.; that no young man who had not served an apprenticeship for five years
should work for himself at the mine <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>or coal, nor should any
of the &ldquo;labourers&rdquo; do so unless they had worked seven years,
neither was any young man to carry coal, &amp;c., unless he was a
householder; and that none should sue for mine, &amp;c., but in the Court
of the Mine, under the penalty &ldquo;of 100 dozen of good sufficient oare
or coale, the one-half to be forfeited to the King, and the other halfe to
the myner that will sue for the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; The originals of this
foregoing, and of the seventeen succeeding &ldquo;Orders,&rdquo; written on
parchment, are preserved in the office of the Deputy Gaveller at
Coleford.&nbsp; The forty-eight signatures to it are almost effaced, and
about half have &ldquo;marks&rdquo; affixed to them, but the whole are
written in the same hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new Act of 1668 was soon brought into operation.&nbsp; Immediately
after it had passed, upwards of 8,487 acres of open land were enclosed and
planted, the remaining 2,513 acres being taken in some time
afterwards.&nbsp; The following statement of Mr. Agar, then surveyor of the
woods, shows that the cost of making the enclosures was raised as the Act
directed.&nbsp; He said that he &ldquo;received several sums of money by
the sale of cordwood to Mr. Foley and divers others, and of the timber that
did happen to arise out of the old oaks and beeches felled for the cordwood
and other uses, and of wood that I <i>sold</i> to the colliers for their
pits, in the whole amounting to &pound;5,125 8s. 9&frac14;d., which money
was expended in buying Cannope, &amp;c., of Banistree Maynard, Esq., at
&pound;1,500; in setting up his Majesty&rsquo;s Enclosures in the said
Forest, of 8,400 acres, with gates, stiles, &amp;c., and some reparations
of them; in employing a sworn surveyor to admeasure them; in building part
of the Speech House; in divers repairs at Saint Briavel&rsquo;s Castle; in
the charge of executing two several commissions, and other services in the
said Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In allusion to the item of timber <i>sold</i> to the colliers, the
commissioners, in their report of 1788, remark:&mdash;&ldquo;Immediately
after the passing of the Act of 1668, the colliers, who, it is said, now
pretend to have a right to whatever timber they find necessary for carrying
on their works in the Forest, without paying anything for it, then
purchased it from the Crown.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems also that &ldquo;the
Speech House&rdquo; was then commenced, although it was not finished until
1682.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>The <i>second</i> existing Order of the Mine Law Court states that
it met in 1674, on the 9th March, at Clowerwall, before Sir George Probert,
deputy constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, chiefly with the design of
raising a fund for defending in a legal way the rights of the free miners,
and affording them support when injured at their work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To these ends a payment of 6d. per quarter was levied upon each miner,
digging for or carrying mineral, if fifteen years of age, as also upon
every horse so used, payable within fourteen days, under a fine of
2s.&nbsp; Six collectors were to receive the above payments, to be
remunerated at the rate of 1s. per quarter for each pound they
gathered.&nbsp; Twice a year they handed in their accounts, under a penalty
of &pound;5, and perpetual exclusion from any office of trust, if such were
found defective.&nbsp; It appears therefore that the free miners valued
their rights, and not only took thought for the morrow, but provided for
it.&nbsp; They added a proviso that the servants of the Deputy Constable
should have the benefit of always being supplied first at the pits, showing
that they knew something also of public diplomacy.&nbsp; This
&ldquo;Order&rdquo; has the names of forty-eight miners attached, all
severally sealed, but written in one hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this year also (1674) it was suggested that if the King would put the
old iron-works of the Forest in repair, and also build one furnace and two
forges, all which might be done for &pound;1,000, a clear profit of
&pound;2,190 could be made upon every 8,000 long and short cords of wood,
of which the Forest was in a condition to supply a vast quantity.&nbsp;
This proposal was nevertheless not acted upon, it being judged desirable
rather to pull down the old iron-works than erect new, lest the waste in
supplying the necessary quantities of wood should ultimately prove
destructive to the Forest, now in a flourishing condition.&nbsp;
Accordingly the iron-works then standing were ordered to be pulled down,
and the materials sold.&nbsp; The greatest attention is admitted by the
commissioners of 1788, who examined the office papers relating to this
period, to have been given by the then Ministers of State, by Sir Charles
Harbord, surveyor-general of the Crown lands, and by his son and successor
Mr. William Harbord, to the protection of the young wood and the
enclosures; and they affirm that &ldquo;it is chiefly in those parts of the
Forest which <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>were then enclosed that the timber with which the dockyards have
been since furnished from this Forest has been felled, and in which any
considerable quantity of useful timber may now be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 28th of September, 1675, at the recommendation of Sir Charles
Harbord, to whom the plan was probably suggested by the precedent of the
ten bailiwicks into which the district had been anciently divided, the
Forest was formed into six &ldquo;walks,&rdquo; or districts, a keeper
being appointed to each.&nbsp; Six lodges were built for their use in
convenient situations, with 30 acres of land attached, &ldquo;for the
better encouragement and enabling of the said keepers to attend and watch
over the said enclosures within their several walks, and to preserve the
same, and the young springs of wood and trees thereon growing, and to grow
from time to time, from spoil and harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; The names given to
each of the six divisions were derived from some of the most eminent living
characters of that day.&nbsp; Thus, the Speech House, or King&rsquo;s Walk,
was so called after Charles II.; York Walk and Lodge after the Duke of
York; Danby Walk and Lodge after the Earl of Danby, prime Minister at the
time; Worcester Walk and Lodge after Henry Marquis of Worcester, the then
constable of the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, and warden of the Forest;
Latimer Walk and Lodge after Viscount Latimer; and Herbert Walk and Lodge
after Lord Herbert; in the two last instances, out of compliment to the
Worcester family apparently.&nbsp; The Speech House was so called from its
being intended for the use of the ancient Court of &ldquo;the
Speech,&rdquo; as mentioned in the Laws and Franchises of the Mine.&nbsp;
Now also a grant of sixty tons of timber was made by the King towards
rebuilding the parish church of Newent, as a tablet therein declares.</p>
<p>How strictly the enclosures were preserved at this time against all
mining operations, is shown by the refusal which Sir Charles Harbord gave
to a petition presented to the Treasury by several gentlemen and
freeholders of the parish of Newland, for leave to make <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>a coal level through an
enclosure, although they were backed by Sir Baynham Throckmorton,
Deputy-Governor of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, who had also been one of the
Commissioners first appointed for carrying out the Act of 1668, and who
gave it as his opinion that agreeing to the prayer of the petition would
conduce to the preservation of the woods in the Forest, and the convenience
and advantage of the country.&nbsp; The wording of the refusal was very
peremptory, to the effect that &ldquo;the enclosures could only be
preserved for timber by being kept discharged from all claims;&rdquo; that
&ldquo;although miners and quarrymen had been long permitted to dig where
they pleased, yet that they could not prove their right to do so; and as to
coal-works, any such claims were unknown, much less any liberty of cutting
his Majesty&rsquo;s woods for the support thereof; and the same ought to be
totally suppressed, and would be so by a good officer, as Colonel Wade was
in the time of the Usurpation, and that only by the Forest Law, and the
ordinary authority of a Justice of Peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not unlikely
that in the last observation a hint was intended to be given to Sir Baynham
Throckmorton, lest he should compromise his independent position with the
colliers in the Forest by publicly accepting, as he had done the year
before at their Mine Law Court, &ldquo;their thankfull acknowledgment of
the many favors received by them from him,&rdquo; in return for which they
agreed that, when he &ldquo;should send his own horses or waynes to any of
the colepitts for cole, the miners shall presently seame and load them
before any other person whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing over an interval of three years, we come to the date of the
<i>third</i> of the Mine Law Courts, held on the 8th September, 1678, at
&ldquo;Clowerwall,&rdquo; before Sir Baynham Throckmorton, &amp;c., whose
favour it shows the free-miners were most anxious to preserve, since, upon
understanding that the former order of 1668, forbidding any foreigner to
convey or deliver minerals, had proved prejudicial to him and his friends
and tenants, they now revoked the same, allowing any foreigner to carry
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>fire
or lime coal for his own use; besides which, they constituted the Marquis
of Worcester, the then Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, as well as
Sir Baynham Throckmorton, his Deputy, &ldquo;free miners to all intents and
purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This same Court decided that &ldquo;the Winchester bushell, three of
which were to make a barrell,&rdquo; should be the constant measure for
&ldquo;iron ore and coale,&rdquo; 4d. being the smallest price allowed to
be taken for &ldquo;a barrell of fire coale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pits having
become numerous, they decreed that &ldquo;none should presume to sink a pit
within 100 yards of one already made without the consent of the
undertakers, under a penalty of 100 dozen of good fire coale&rdquo; (which
is the earliest regulation for protecting coal-works).&nbsp; Lastly, six
&ldquo;barganers&rdquo; were to fix the price at which iron ore should be
sold or carried to the different works.&nbsp; The names of forty-eight
miners are appended to this &ldquo;order,&rdquo; all written in the same
hand opposite their respective marks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The importance of securing a supply of timber for the navy led to
frequent Commissions of Inquiry, and the issue of Instructions, with
respect to the royal forests.&nbsp; The Marquis of Worcester, Warden of
Dean Forest, made a Return, on the 23rd of April, 1680, minutely describing
the condition of the older trees, as well as of those planted ten years
before, together with the state of the fences surrounding the new
plantations.&nbsp; Parts of several of the enclosures are reported to have
trees which were grown up out of the reach of cattle, and therefore fit to
be thrown open, an equal quantity of waste land being enclosed instead,
which was accordingly done by warrant, dated 21st July, 1680, not more than
eleven years from the time they were taken in: consequently the young trees
must have grown with rapidity, or else were left to take their chance very
early.&nbsp; With the design as it would seem of making room for the new
plantations, it is further stated that &ldquo;there were remaining about 30
cabins, in several parts of the Forest, inhabited by about 100 poor people,
and that they had taken care to demolish the said cabins, and the
enclosures about them.&rdquo;&nbsp; It should be remarked that these poor
people must not be classed with the &ldquo;free miners&rdquo; of the
Forest, although &ldquo;they had been born in it, and never lived
elsewhere,&rdquo; but <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>as &ldquo;cabiners,&rdquo; who had to work
seven years in the pits before they could become &ldquo;free.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The <i>fourth</i> Record of the Mine Law Court informs us that it sat
before Sir Baynham Throckmorton on the 27th April, 1680, at the Speech
House, yet barely completed, unless it were the spacious Court-room,
devoted to the public business of the Forest, for which it has been <!--
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>used ever
since.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Order&rdquo; then passed implies, that although the
last Court had appointed six &ldquo;bargainers&rdquo; to deal with the
difficult question of valuing the minerals offered for sale, inconvenience
was yet experienced on this head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was therefore decreed that a dozen Winchester bushels of iron ore
should be delivered at St. Wonnarth&rsquo;s furnace for 10s.; at
Whitchurch, for 7s.; at Bishopswood, for 9s.; at Linton, for 9s.; at
Longhope, for 9s.; at Flaxley, for 8s.; at Gunsmills (if rebuilt), for 7s.;
at Blackney, for 6s.; at Lydney, for 6s.; at those in the Forest lately
demolished (if rebuilt), for the same as before; at Redbrooke, for 4s. 6d.;
at the Abbey, viz. Tintern, for 9s.; at Brockweare, for 6s. 6d.; at
Redbrooke Passage, for 5s. 6d.; at Gunspill, for 7s.&nbsp; So also no house
or smith&rsquo;s coal was to be delivered on the banks of the Wye, below
Huntsam Ferry, for less than 8s. a dozen bushels, or for 4s. 6d. if only
lime coal; and if above Huntsam, 3s. 6d., on a forfeiture of 100 dozen of
good iron ore, the one half to his Majesty, and the other to the miner that
will sue for the same, together with loss of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and
utter expulsion from the mine-works&mdash;a very heavy penalty for such an
offence, showing the arbitrary power assumed by the court, at one time
conferring free-minership upon strangers and foreigners, and at another
deposing the free miner merely for an over or even an under charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;order&rdquo; likewise informs us that the instructions given
in 1674, to pull down the King&rsquo;s iron-works in the Forest, had been
so thoroughly executed, that all the furnaces were ere this demolished,
leaving such only to be supplied with ore as were situated beyond the
Forest limits.&nbsp; These furnaces seem to have taken about 600 dozen
bushels of ore at one time, during the delivery of which no second party
was allowed to come in.&nbsp; It is signed by fourteen out of the
forty-eight free miners in their own hands, which is so far an improvement;
but if the iron trade was unpromising, owing to the course which the
Government felt constrained to take, lest its development should endanger
the timber, it was not so with the coal, the getting of which the Crown
would obviously regard with favour, in the hope that it would relieve the
woods from spoliation.&nbsp; Accordingly, we shall find that from about
this period on through the next century coal-works were constantly on the
increase, so as eventually to throw the getting of iron-ore into the
shade.&nbsp; This last <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>&ldquo;order&rdquo; cancelled an agreement
passed by the Mine Law Court on the 9th of March, 1675, to the effect that
a legal-defence fund be raised; but it confirmed the decree of a former
court forbidding any young man to set up for himself as a free miner unless
he was upwards of twenty-one years of age, and had served by indenture an
apprenticeship of five years, and had also given a bond of ten pounds to
obey all the orders of the said court.</p>
<p>One of the most minute of the various perambulations of this Forest
dates from about this time, and serves to identify several spots, the early
names of which have long passed away.&nbsp; On this occasion nineteen
&ldquo;regarders&rdquo; went the rounds, preserving much the same course as
the bounds of 28 Edward I.</p>
<p>The next, or <i>fifth</i> session of the Mine Law Court was held at
Clearwell, on the 19th of September, 1682, Henry Melborne and William
Wolseley, Esqrs., acting as joint deputies for the Marquis of Worcester,
constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It confirmed, for the most part, the &ldquo;orders&rdquo; already
issued, and further exacted the payment, within six days, of 6d. from every
miner thirteen years of age and upwards, and an additional 6d. for every
horse used in carrying mineral, &ldquo;for raising a present sum of money
for urgent occasions,&rdquo; and required all coal-pits which had been
wrought out to be sufficiently secured.&nbsp; Only fourteen signatures are
attached to this &ldquo;order,&rdquo; the remaining thirty-four free miners
making their &ldquo;marks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the course of the next year, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1683, a
scheme resembling that proposed ten years before was started by Sir John
Erule, supervisor or conservator of the Forest.&nbsp; His project was to
raise &pound;5,390 a year for the Crown, upon an outlay, in the first
place, of no more than &pound;1,000, to be spent in building iron-works,
and an annual consumption of 8,000 cords of wood out of the Forest, care
being taken that no oak or beech-tree, fit or likely to become fit for
shipbuilding, be used.&nbsp; The Lords of the Treasury referred the plan to
Mr. William Harbord and Mr. Agar, to be investigated and reported on.&nbsp;
They rejected it however, as was done in the former case, and for the same
reason, namely, that if carried out it would prove injurious to the woods
and timber.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>The <i>sixth</i> order of the Court of Mine Law records that it
assembled on the 8th of December, 1685, at Clearwell, before William
Wolseley, Esq., deputy to the Duke of Beaufort, constable of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s Castle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its principal design seems to have been that of confirming the former
6d. rate, and authorizing the same to be raised to 10s., if necessary,
towards keeping up a fund for supporting the miners&rsquo; claims at law,
which of late they had been obliged to do in the Court of Exchequer against
Mr. Beck and others.&nbsp; The order concludes with the following
direction: &ldquo;That one-half of the jury should be iron-miners, and the
other half colliers,&rdquo; so rapidly had coal-mining advanced, and so
important had its condition become.&nbsp; An examination of the original
document shows this order to have been signed by one person writing down
the names of the forty-eight free miners, since they all exhibit the same
hand-writing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>seventh</i> of the orders still extant reports the Court of the
Mine to have been held at Clearwell on the 5th of April, 1687, before
William Wolseley, Esq., and commences by stating that more money was wanted
for legal purposes, and that every miner must pay two shillings, with two
shillings besides for every mine-horse, towards meeting them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It likewise directed that each coal-pit and dangerous mine-pit, if left
unworked for a whole month together, should be fenced with a stone wall or
posts and rails, under a penalty of 10s.&nbsp; All previous orders, fixing
the prices at which the minerals of the Forest were alone to be sold, were
now abolished, not having been found to answer; and all miners were left at
liberty to sell or carry and deliver their ore and coal to whom, where, and
how they pleased; and whereas previously all colliers were entitled to be
first served at the pits, now it was ordained that the inhabitants of the
hundred should precede the trade, and that those miners only should keep
horses who had land sufficient to feed them.&nbsp; The following provision
speaks for itself&mdash;&ldquo;For the restrayning that pernicious and
abominable sinne of perjury too much used in these licentious times, every
myner convicted by a jury of 48 miners in the said Court shall for ever
loose and totally forfeite his freedome as touching the mines, and bee
utterly expelled out of the same, and all his working tooles and habitt be
burnt before his face, and he never afterwards to be a witness or to be
believed in any matter whatsoever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of the forty-eight jurymen
whose names are appended to the above, sixteen signed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was in the month of January following (1688) that a riotous
assemblage of the people pulled down <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Worcester Lodge and
York Lodge, besides much defacing and spoiling the Speech House; an outrage
connected probably with the unpopularity of James II., after whom the
Speech House and York Lodge were called.&nbsp; With reference to the
general feeling of the neighbourhood respecting the principles of the
Revolution, Mr. Pyrke, of Dean Hall, states that the release of Lord
Lovelace, a supporter of the Prince of Orange, out of Gloucester prison,
was effected by &ldquo;a young gentleman of that county,&rdquo; an ancestor
of his, &ldquo;who took up arms for the Prince, and drove out all the
Popish crew that were settled in that city,&rdquo; and that the exploit has
been handed down in the following rude lines, sung by his haymakers at
their harvest supper:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A health to Captain Pyrke, who in Little Dean was bred,<br />
And of a thousand men he was the head;<br />
He fought for the truth and the Protestant faith;<br />
We drink his good health, and so do rejoice.</p>
<p>He down in the West King William did meet,<br />
And to him he sent both oxen and sheep,<br />
Till he had an order which from him did come,<br />
And with honour to Gloucester he brought him along.</p>
<p>When he came to Gloucester he had but forty men,<br />
The city of Gloucester all barred unto him;<br />
The city was guarded with soldiers about,<br />
But he brought Lord Lovelace from his prison quite out.</p>
<p>With sword in his hand he before them did go;<br />
He was not ashamed his face for to show:<br />
&lsquo;They who have anything to say to Lord Lovelace,&rsquo; said he,<br
/>
&lsquo;O then, if they have, let them speak it to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then up to the Mayor away he did get,<br />
And his wooden god to pieces did beat;<br />
And the big golden chair where King James sate<br />
He threw in the fire, which made a brave heat.</p>
<p>Then up into Oxfordshire away he did ride,<br />
To bring Lord Lovelace safe home;<br />
He plundered the Papists along as he goes,<br />
He could not endure to see us abused.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two years later than the date of the above outrages, wood-fellings to
the extent of 6,186 short cords were made, pursuant to their
Majesties&rsquo; letters of Privy Seal.&nbsp; <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>They were sold, it is
said, for six shillings a cord, which was considered a good price for the
county of Gloucester.</p>
<p>A period of about five years from the time that the last was held brings
us to the date of the <i>eighth</i> record of the Mine Law Court, viz. the
17th of January, 1692.&nbsp; It was held at Clearwell, before the three
deputies of the Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, <i>i.e.</i> Tracy
Catchmay, John Higford, and George Bond, Esqrs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Court levied a further contribution of 12d. upon every miner, with
an additional 1s. on every mine horse, with which to clear off certain
charges incurred in a recent suit in the Court of Exchequer at
Westminster.&nbsp; It extended the protective distance of 100 yards, within
which every pit was guarded from being encroached upon by any other work,
to 300 yards.&nbsp; It also provided that no iron ore intended for Ireland
should be shipped on the Severn or Wye for a less sum than 6s. 6d. for
every dozen bushels.&nbsp; This order was signed by sixteen out of the
forty-eight miners with their own hands, the rest making their marks
only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this period is assigned Dr. Parsons&rsquo;s quaint remarks on the
Forest.&nbsp; &ldquo;It abounds,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with springs for
the most part of a brownish or umber colour, occasioned by their passage
through the veynes of oker, of which there is a great plenty, or else
through the rushy tincture of the mineralls of the ore.&nbsp; The ground of
the Forest is more inclined to wood and cole than corn, yet they have
enough of it too.&nbsp; The inhabitants are, some of them, a sort of
robustic wild people, that must be civilized by good discipline and
government.&nbsp; The ore and cinder wherewith they make their iron (which
is the great imployment of the poorer sort of inhabitants) &rsquo;tis dug
in most parts of y<sup>e</sup> Forest, one in the bowells, and the other
towards the surface of the earth.&nbsp; But, whether it be by virtue of the
Forrest laws, or other custome, the head Gaviler of the Forrest, or others
deputed by him, provided they were born in the Hundred of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s, may go into any man&rsquo;s grounds whatsoever, within the
limitation of the Forrest, and dig or delve for ore and cinders without any
molestation.&nbsp; There are two sorts of ore: the best ore is your brush
ore, of a blewish colour, very ponderous and full of shining specks <!--
page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>like
grains of silver; this affordeth the greatest quantity of iron, but being
melted alone produceth a mettal very short and brittle.&nbsp; To remedy
this inconvenience, they make use of another material which they call
cinder, it being nothing else but the refuse of the ore after the melting
hath been extracted, which, being melted with the other in due quantity,
gives it that excellent temper of toughness for which this iron is
preferred before any other that is brought from foreign parts.&nbsp; But it
is to be noted that in former times, when their works were few and their
vents small, they made use of no other bellows but such as were moved by
the strength of men, by reason whereof their fires were much less intense
than in the furnaces they now imploy; so that, having in them only melted
downe the principal part of the ore, they rejected the rest as useless, and
not worth their charge: this they call their cinder, and is found in an
inexhaustible quantity throughout all the parts of the country where any
glomerys formerly stood, for so they were then called.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="headingsummary">Condition of the Forest described, and management
examined&mdash;Depredations&mdash;Ninth and tenth orders of the
Miners&rsquo; Court&mdash;Timber injured by the colliers&mdash;The Forest

seventeenth orders of the Miners&rsquo; Court&mdash;Grant of 9200 feet of
timber to the Gloucester Infirmary.</p>
<p>Reverting to the general condition and management of the Forest, an
important commission was issued this year, 1692, to the Crown officers and
some of the neighbouring gentry, directing them to examine and inquire into
the six following particulars:&mdash;I.&nbsp; The quantity of coppicewood
fit for being cut from year to year for twenty-one years to
come&mdash;II.&nbsp; The annual charge for the next twenty-one years of
maintaining the enclosures&mdash;III.&nbsp; What the cost would be of
disenclosing certain coal-pits, with which some of the plantations were
encumbered&mdash;IV.&nbsp; What the salaries of the Crown officers of the
Forest amounted to, and the cost of making such repairs as the buildings
they occupied required&mdash;V.&nbsp; As to the way in which the timber
fellings of 1688 had been disposed of, with the state of the enclosures, if
those who had charge of them had duly protected them from injury&mdash;and
VI.&nbsp; How far trespass and pounding had been enforced, or unlawful
building permitted.</p>
<p>These were all very important questions, and under the first head, as to
wood fit to be cut for cording, &amp;c., the commissioners report, that
&ldquo;there are great and <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>valuable quantities of scrubbed beech and
birch, with some holly, hazel, and orle, fit to be cut and disposed of,
being 192,000 cords, worth at 4s. 10d., amounting to &pound;46,488, of
which 12,000 cords might be cut every year, worth &pound;2,900.&nbsp; Or,
as the total quantity of such wood was 615,500 cords, their worth at 4s.
10d. was &pound;148,745 16s. 8d., to which &pound;60,000 may safely be
added for future clearings if a twenty-one years&rsquo; lease be
granted.&nbsp; &pound;100 a year would suffice to keep the enclosures in
repair.&rdquo;&nbsp; The commissioners, in contemplating the expediency of
making a grant adapted to the requirements of iron-making, supposing the
King&rsquo;s furnaces to be restored, considered that it &ldquo;would
utterly destroy the Forest, now the best nursery for a navy in the
world;&rdquo; since the party obtaining such a lease would be sure to
consider their own advantage rather than the preservation of the
district.&nbsp; They also urged that a grant like that intimated was
opposed to the intentions of the Act of 20th Charles II., as also to the
previous decisions of 1662 and 1674, and would cause much dissatisfaction
amongst the freeholders of the Forest, who were prepared to petition
against it.&nbsp; The commissioners recommended that &ldquo;the making of
the fellets, if put in execution, should certainly be intrusted to the
present officers, who had given sufficient testimony of their care in such
matters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their report adds that &ldquo;the Lea Bayly is now a
spring of oak and beech of four, five, and six years&rsquo; growth, but
much cropped and spoiled by cattle, by reason the enclosures made for the
preservation thereof have in the night been several times pulled down and
destroyed by persons unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other places mentioned in
the Act of 1668, called &ldquo;Cannop Fellet, Buckholt, Beachenhurst, and
Moyey Stock,&rdquo; are described as &ldquo;generally very well grown with
oak and beech of fifty, forty, and thirty years&rsquo; growth, and under,
many thousand of them being forty foot and upwards, without a bough to hurt
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; They further state, that some of the enclosure fences,
especially those on the north-east side of the Forest, would <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>cost &pound;137
10s. to repair, and &pound;30 a year afterwards, perhaps, to keep them
good, the other parts formerly enclosed not needing reparation, the trees
being grown up past danger from deer or cattle, &ldquo;unless in case of
some accident, or pulling down by the rabble, as hath been sometimes
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; Viewing the places where the last fellets for cordwood
were made in 1690, the commissioners state that &ldquo;a very great stock
has been left upon the ground for timber, and all imaginable care taken by
the officers employed in making the said fellets, and preserving all the
stores and saplings, with the principal shoots of such beech as grow upon
old stools well sheltered by other woods, for the improvement
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; With reference to the expediency of throwing open
such of the enclosures as contained coal-pits, we learn that no
inconvenience was felt on that account, as &ldquo;not more than six pits
had ever been so situated, and now not one, those plantations having grown
up, and their fences down.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sum total of salaries paid to
the conservators and six keepers was &pound;210 per annum, arising from
wood sales.&nbsp; Various repairs are stated to have been necessary.&nbsp;
The Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, it is said, &ldquo;hath been a very
great and ancient building, but the greatest part is ruined and fallen
down, and only some part kept up for a place to hold the courts in for the
King&rsquo;s manor and hundred thereof, and also for a prison for debtors
attached by process out of the said courts, and for offenders and
trespassers within the Forest.&nbsp; The same is very necessary to be
repaired; and for mending the roof and tyling, and in glazing, plaistering,
repairing the prison windows, and building a new pound, &amp;c., will cost
the sum of &pound;10 14s. 2d.&nbsp; The cost of rebuilding Worcester and
York Lodges, pulled down by the rioters in 1688, and repairing the Speech
House, which was likewise much injured at that time, will be, they
calculate, &pound;219 10s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to injury done to the woods, the following presentments amongst many
others made by the keepers were instanced:&mdash;&ldquo;John Simons of
Blackney, for cutting <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>green orle wood.&nbsp; Edward Revoke and James
Drew of Little Dean, for cutting and carrying away a young oak.&nbsp; The
same Edward Revoke, for building some part of his house with wood out of
the said Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Respecting these depredations the
commissioners recommend that, in consideration of the colliers having, time
out of mind, had an allowance of wood, but not timber for the support of
their pits, but which has been stopped for some time, it may be again
allowed to them by order of the verderers, and taken by view of a woodward
or keeper.&nbsp; The Attachment and Swainmote Courts are stated to have
been &ldquo;duly kept, although ineffectually to the preservation of the
Forest, as they can only convict, but cannot punish; and that the
trespass-money paid into the said courts in this reign does not exceed 5s.,
the only remedy being in having a justice seat held for the purpose once a
year, for six or seven years.&rdquo;&nbsp; The report is signed by Wm.
Cooke, Re Pynder, Wm. Boevey, J. Viney, Jo. Kyrle, Phil. Ryley.</p>
<p>The <i>ninth</i> Mine Law Court was held on the 25th of April, 1694, at
Clearwell, before John Higford and George Bond, Esqrs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It confirmed the punishment already awarded against &ldquo;the
abominable sin of perjury,&rdquo; to prevent which it directs that
&ldquo;no person shall be permitted to sweare in his own cause unless it be
for a matter transacted underground, or where it was difficult to have any
witnesses;&rdquo; nor shall any bargain be binding unless it be proved by
two witnesses.</p>
<p>All causes of debt or damage amounting to 40s. were to be heard on both
sides as in other courts, the verdict being given by a jury of twelve
miners; but in lesser causes by the Constable of the Court.&nbsp; Provision
was also made that &ldquo;every defendant have twenty-four hours&rsquo;
notice to provide for his defence,&rdquo; every witness being allowed 12p.
a-day, the fees of the Court remaining the same as before, all which, as
well as the defendant&rsquo;s time, the plaintiff losing the cause, or
being non-suited, had to pay.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Order&rdquo; also reduces
the price of ore for Ireland from 8s. to 5s. a dozen bushels, pitched at
Brockwere, or if at Wye&rsquo;s Green for 4s. ditto; fire-cole at 8s. a
dozen bushels; smith&rsquo;s-cole, 6s., and charking at 8s., &ldquo;without
handing, thrusting, kicking, or knocking the same,&rdquo; under the usual
penalty.&nbsp; Eighteen miners out of the jury of forty-eight signed their
names themselves &ldquo;to this Order,&rdquo; the remaining thirty only
making their marks.</p>

1701, on the 27th January, in which year the <i>tenth</i> Miners&rsquo;
Court of forty-eight sat at Clearwell, before Serjeant Powlett and George
Bond, Esq., deputies to Charles Earl of Berkeley.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its proceedings were as follows:&mdash;Certain temporary orders, dated
the 12th March, 1699, and 11th November, 1700, regulating the loading of
horses and carts, forbidding any coal to be sent off by the river Wye below
Welch-Bicknor, authorizing the raising of money for paying the costs of the
miners&rsquo; debts in law, securing the Records of their Court, and making
the present deputy constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle a free miner,
were confirmed and made perpetual.&nbsp; Mention is also made for the first
time of &ldquo;the utmost seventy&rdquo; being the greatest number ever
comprised in the miners&rsquo; jury.&nbsp; The order further directs that
the Records of Mine-law, used at the hearing of the suit in the Exchequer,
be recorded, and put into a chest, to be left in the custody of Francis
Wyndham, Esq., whom the court had made a free miner, and that in paying any
of the costs incurred in that cause a legal discharge be taken.&nbsp; Now
the ton of 21 cwt. was fixed as a weight of coal, to be sold for 5s. to an
inhabitant of the hundred, or for 6s. to foreigners; and every pit was to
be provided with scales.&nbsp; Upwards of twenty of the forty-eight miners
who formed the jury at this court put their names to the above verdict, the
remainder being marksmen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1705, Edward Wilcox, Esq., Surveyor-General to the Royal
Forests, having carefully examined the condition of the woods in the Forest
of Dean, stated that he found them very full of young trees, of which two
thirds were beech, overtopping the oaks, to their injury; and he
recommended that one sixteenth part, or about 700 acres, should be annually
cleared and fenced in, which would yield a profit to the Crown of
&pound;3,500 a year, and leave the standard oaks and beech to grow to
perfection.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer Godolphin consented to this proposal, and
granted a warrant for carrying it into execution; but it was petitioned
against by those who claimed a right of common, whose free-pasturage would
thereby be lessened; at the same time, however, others were desirous that
it might take effect, as they would get a living by cutting the underwood,
and preparing it for the furnaces.&nbsp; At length on the 4th of July,
1707, the Attorney-General, Sir Simon Harcourt, decided&mdash;that
&ldquo;no claim or right of common could <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>prevent the enclosing,
keeping in severalty, or improving, as her Majesty should direct, the
11,000 acres mentioned in the Act of 20 Charles II., and preserving the
same as a nursery of wood and timber only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another event of this year was the holding a Court of Mine Law, on the
1st of July, at Mitcheldean, but afterwards by adjournment at Coleford,
before George Bond and Roynon Jones, Esqrs., deputies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It confirmed the directions of a former court of forty-eight, that the
law-papers produced at the late suit in the Court of Exchequer, with all
the other records of the Mine Law Court, be collected forthwith, and
consigned to the care of Francis Wyndham, Esq.; and that the law debts then
incurred be at length paid, out of a 1s. rate upon every miner and
mine-horse.&nbsp; The 20s. penalty for leaving pits unfenced was also
reimposed.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Order&rdquo; bears the genuine signatures of
nineteen out of the forty-eight jurymen, the rest merely making their
marks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next year, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1708, Mr. Wilcox, the
Surveyor-General, represented to Lord Godolphin that the inhabitants of the
neighbourhood had been stripping some of the trees of their bark, whereupon
those trees, with any others not likely to be of any use to the navy, were
ordered to be cut down and used for gates, stiles, and fences, or sold for
the benefit of the Crown.&nbsp; Three years later a similar charge was
preferred against certain colliers for cutting trees and wood, but we do
not find that it came to anything.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Atkyns, to whom this Forest was well known, describes its
condition at this time, as &ldquo;containing only six houses, which are the
lodges for so many keepers.&nbsp; There had been many cottages erected, but
they had been lately pulled down;&rdquo; not that there were literally no
other dwellings in it, for the ancient &ldquo;assarted&rdquo; lands were
probably so occupied, but the mining population lived for the most part in
the surrounding villages.&nbsp; Speaking of the different Forest courts, he
says&mdash;&ldquo;the Swainmote Court is to preserve the vert and venison,
and is kept at the Speech-house, which is a large strong house, newly built
in the middle of the Forest for that purpose.&nbsp; There is another court
called the Miners&rsquo; Court, which is <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>directed by a steward
appointed by the constable of the Forest, and by juries of miners, returned
to judge between miner and miner, who have their particular laws and
customs, to prevent their encroaching upon one another, and to encourage
them to go on quietly in their labour in digging after coals and iron-ore,
with which this Forest doth abound.&rdquo;&nbsp; The room in which most of
these courts were held retains its original character, only it has been
floored with wood, and is no longer divided by rails into compartments for
the jury and the accused.&nbsp; Stains of human blood once marked <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the ceiling
over the north-east corner of the apartment, said to have dropped down from
the room above, where an unfortunate poacher, who had been much injured by
a gun, was confined.&nbsp; It is asserted that for many years no water
could remove nor whitewash hide the unsightly marks.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In the Commissioners&rsquo; Report of 1788 it is said that about this
time (1712) the Forest was probably in its best state, although its courts
had not been so regularly held since the Revolution as before, yet that the
greatest attention had been given to it by the different authorities under
the Crown.&nbsp; And as the commissioners deplore the unfavourable change
which had subsequently taken place, we may contrast the state into which
the Forest had then fallen, with its present condition, so much more
hopeful and lucrative than it had been at that the brightest period of its
past history.&nbsp; There are no public documents relating to this Forest
to be met with for many years from this time; indeed it is hardly ever
mentioned in the book of the Surveyor-General of the Crown lands, which
only contained warrants for felling timber for the navy or for sale.&nbsp;
The produce was for the most part directed to be applied to the repairing
of lodges, roads, or fences, or the payment of salaries to officers, or
fee-gifts from the Crown.&nbsp; The proceedings of the Court of the Miners,
on the contrary, remain recorded, and serve to fill up the interval.&nbsp;
They show that one was held at the Speech-house on the 7th of January,
1717, before Richard Machen and William James, Esqrs., deputies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By it a 6d. levy was made on every miner, and on every working horse,
towards meeting any law expenses which the Society of Miners might incur in
defending their rights; and should more money be required, authorizing a
jury of only twelve miners, with the consent of the two deputy-constables,
to order the paying of the same.&nbsp; It further imposed a fine of upwards
of &pound;30 on any miner who should sue another respecting any matter
relating to the mine in any other court.&nbsp; It also constituted the
Honourable Matthew Ducie Morton, Thomas Gage, John Wyndham, Richard Machen,
William James, and Christopher Bond, Esqrs., free miners, &ldquo;out of the
due and great respect, honour, and esteem borne towards them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We need not call in question the truthfulness of such <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>protestations; but
doubtless, had these worthy miners perceived the inconsistency of such
admissions, they would not have so readily dispensed with the ancient
regulation which restricted the fellowship of the mine to those who had
worked therein.&nbsp; They were well intended at the time, but long
afterwards weakened in a legal point of view the free miners&rsquo;
rights.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Order&rdquo; exhibits only eleven original
signatures, the thirty-seven other jurymen making their marks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only two years intervened between the holding of the Court just
mentioned, and the one which followed it, held at the Speech House, on 10th
November, 1719, before Richard Machen and William James, Esqrs.,
Deputies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On this occasion certain previous orders were cancelled, and in their
stead it was determined that no one living out of the Hundred of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s should convey any coal out of the Forest unless he belonged
to the Forest division of the county, and carried for his own private
use.&nbsp; A penalty of &pound;5 was imposed upon any person under
twenty-one years of age carrying ore or coal.&nbsp; All traffic in coal,
either up or down the Wye, was to stop at Welch Bicknor, between which and
Monmouth Bridge no coal was to be pitched.&nbsp; At Monmouth, fire-coal was
to be sold at 9s. the dozen bushels; smith&rsquo;s-coal at 8s.; and
lime-coal at 5s. 6d.&nbsp; Above Lydbrook, on the Wye, fire-coal was to be
sold at 8s. a ton, or the dozen barrels; smith&rsquo;s-coal at 6s.; and
lime-coal at 3s.&nbsp; One free miner was not to sell any fire-coal to
another under 5s. per ton of 21 cwt.&nbsp; Roynon Jones and Edmund Probyn,
Esqrs., were made free miners.&nbsp; Lastly, any former orders in private
hands, together with all writings relating to the Free-miners&rsquo; Court,
were to be delivered to William James, Esq., to be kept in the said
miners&rsquo; chest, at the Speech-house.&nbsp; Perhaps this direction was,
with few exceptions, complied with, not, it would seem, in every case, as
several of those alluded to in the existing orders of the forty-eight
cannot be found.&nbsp; Nineteen signatures made by the parties themselves
occur at the end of this Order; the rest are only marks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nine years passed away before another full Mine Law Court is
recorded.&nbsp; This was on the 12th November, 1728, by adjournment, at the
Speech House, before Maynard Colchester, Esq., and William James, Gent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following gentlemen were made free miners:&mdash;Thomas Wyndham, of
Clearwell; Maynard Colchester, of Westbury; William Hall Gage, son and heir
to Lord Viscount Gage; William Jones, of Nass, Esqrs.; William Jones, of
Soylewell, Gent.; Robert James, of the same place, Gent.; Thomas Wyndham
the younger, of Clearwell, Gent.; Thomas Pyrke the younger, of Little Dean,
Gent.; <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>and William Lane, Deputy Clerk.&nbsp; A forfeit of &pound;10 was
laid upon any miner who had received a &ldquo;forbidment&rdquo; from
another, if he persisted in carrying on his work in that place.&nbsp; The
distance of 300 yards, which, by a former order, made in 1692, protected
every pit from interruption, was now enlarged to 500 yards in all levels in
all parts of the mines called &ldquo;beneath the wood,&rdquo; under the
same penalty; and further, the giving away of coals was forbidden under a
fine of &pound;5.&nbsp; Twenty-two original signatures appear at the foot
of this Order; the other names are merely marked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extension of the Forest coal-works, in depth and underground
operations, as indicated by the enlargement of the protective distance,
effected a corresponding change in the kind of timber required for propping
the mine.&nbsp; That is, as the pressure from above increased, owing to the
workings being carried deeper, stronger stays and supports were necessary
than cordwood or saplings supplied.&nbsp; Nothing less than the stems and
main limbs of timber trees would suffice.&nbsp; How the colliers obtained
these requisites, the particulars given in the following complaint, made in
1735 by the Surveyor-General, show:&mdash;&ldquo;A practice has prevailed
among the colliers of boring large holes in trees that they may become
dotard and decayed, and, as such, may be delivered to them gratis for the
use of their collieries.&rdquo;&nbsp; The only notice, it cannot be called
a remedy, which this evil obtained, was that, for the future, directions
were given that &ldquo;such bored trees as appeared to be dead and spoiled
shall be felled, taking care that none be cut down that may be of use to
the navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, however, further stated, that the colliers frequently obtained
from the keepers the best trees in the Forest, although their claims merely
extended to pit-timber.&nbsp; The existence of so serious an evil proves
that many things were going wrong, and we are prepared for the
representations made the next year (1736) to the Treasury by Christopher
Bond, Esq., Conservator and Supervisor of the Forest.&nbsp; He reported
that &ldquo;after the Act of the 20th Charles II., 11,000 acres had been
enclosed; that the officers were duly elected, Forest courts held, and
offenders prosecuted and punished, to the successful rearing of a fine crop
of wood; but that <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>within the last 30 years these elections had
been neglected, the Courts discontinued, and offenders left unpunished; the
Officers of Inheritance had grown remiss and negligent, so that some
enclosures, and those of only a few acres of the 11,000, were kept up, and
these not carefully repaired; a great number of cottages were erected upon
the borders of the Forest, the inhabitants whereof lived by rapine and
theft; that there were besides many other offences committed, such as
intercommuning of foreigners, surcharges of commoners, trespasses in the
fence month and winter haining, and in the enclosures; keeping hogs, sheep,
goats, and geese, being uncommonable animals, in the Forest; cutting and
burning the nether vert, furze, and fern; gathering and taking away the
crabs, acorns, and mast; and other purprestures and offences; carrying away
such timber trees as were covertly cut down in the night time; by which
practices several hundred fine oaks were yearly destroyed, and the growth
of others prevented; and that it was feared that some of the inferior
officers of the Forest, finding offenders to go on with impunity, were not
only grown negligent, but also connived at, if not partook in, the spoil
daily committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To remedy this bad state of things, Mr. Bond proposed that a new law
should be passed, explanatory of the Act of 1668, by enforcing the Forest
officers to do their duty, and by superseding the odious, because unlimited
and arbitrary, proceedings of the former Chief Justices in Eyre by a jury,
and convictions before the verderers at their Swainmote Court, with a power
lodged in those officers to fine, under a certain sum, all offenders.&nbsp;
The Surveyor-General of the Crown Woods had the above proposal submitted to
his consideration, and was directed to attend the Attorney and
Solicitor-General, Sir John Willis and Sir Dudley Ryder, to take their
opinion thereon, which was, that &ldquo;the offences were chiefly owing to
the neglect of putting the Stat. 20th Charles II. in execution; and they
recommended, therefore, that the several vacant offices of the Forest <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>should be
filled up, that the Forest Courts should be regularly held, and that the
officers should be strictly enjoined to do their duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
disappointing to find no evidence that anything was done in consequence of
this opinion.</p>
<p>About this time the <i>fifteenth</i> of the series of
&ldquo;Orders&rdquo; enacted by the Mine Law Court of forty-eight, informs
us that it met by adjournment at the Speech House on the 6th of December,
1737, before William Jones, Esq., Deputy Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s
Castle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Owing to the injury which it was considered foreigners had done to the
free miners by carrying coal out of the Forest for merchandise, it was
decided that for the future no such carrying should be allowed except to
certain persons named, under a penalty of &pound;5, or property to that
amount, or imprisonment in St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle for a year, to the
perpetrator or any cognizant thereof.&nbsp; From this it seems perfectly
plain that the free miner regarded the carrying of coal as much a part of
his profession as getting it, and therefore equally requiring
protection.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Order&rdquo; proceeds to direct that in every
suit before the Mine-Law Court the plaintiff and defendant were to pay 6d.
to the Clerk for entering the same, which was to form his salary.&nbsp; The
rights of free-minership were conferred upon the Honourable Thomas Gage,
Christopher Bond the younger, Esq., Thomas Crawley, Esq., James Rooke,
Esq., Thomas James, Gent., Thomas Barron the younger, Gent., Thomas
Marshall, Yeoman.&nbsp; John Wade was to be made &ldquo;free&rdquo; on his
working a year and a day in the mine; and making it a rule that a
foreigner&rsquo;s son, being born in the Hundred, and seeking to become a
free miner, was to serve by indenture an apprenticeship of seven
years.&nbsp; The above &ldquo;Order&rdquo; has only twenty-three marks
attached to it, more than half the jury signing their own names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding to the date and objects of the next &ldquo;Order&rdquo; of
the same Court, we find that it had been adjourned to the 2nd March, 1741,
at the Speech House, before Edward Tomkins Machen, Esq., Deputy.&nbsp; It
commences by explaining the terms &ldquo;above&rdquo; and &ldquo;beneath
the wood&rdquo; to be two ancient divisions of the Forest, &ldquo;beginning
at the river Wye at Lydbrook, where the brooke there leading from the
forges falls into the said river, and so up the said brooke or stream unto
a place in the said Forest called Moyery Stock, and from thence along a
Wayn-way at the <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>bottom of a place called the Salley Vallett,
and so along the same way between the two old enclosures that did belong to
Ruardean and Little Dean Walks unto Cannop&rsquo;s Brooke, and down the
said brooke to Cannop&rsquo;s Bridge; and from thence along the road or
highway to the Speech-house, and from thence along the said highway to
Foxe&rsquo;s Bridge, and from thence down Blackpool Brooke to
Blakeney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that the same boundary line, with only a
trifling difference, defines the two townships of East and West Dean, into
which the Forest is now divided for the purposes of the Poor Law Amendment
Act.&nbsp; The connexion of this division with the Court of Mine Law
consisted simply in this, that the attendance of a free miner on the jury
was regulated by the position of his works and habitation in one or other
of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A &pound;5 penalty was laid upon all miners who should send or carry any
coals to Hereford or Monmouth by the Wye, except lime-coal at &ldquo;the
New Wears,&rdquo; at 4s. a dozen bushels.&nbsp; A similar fine was
inflicted on any inhabitant of the Forest division of the county who should
&ldquo;presume&rdquo; to carry coal otherwise than for their own use; so
also no miner was to work more than two pits at one time; nor to carry coal
for any person not a free miner; neither to sell fire-coal or stone-coal
charks under 7s. a dozen bushels, or 5s. if smith&rsquo;s coal, at
Redbrook, which, if refused there, a &ldquo;forbid&rdquo; shall be declared
until the former coal should be accepted.&nbsp; This &ldquo;Order&rdquo;
further enacted that if coal was found in any bargeman&rsquo;s boat, and he
refuse to say from whom he had it, a general &ldquo;forbid&rdquo; shall be
declared that no miner serve him with any more.&nbsp; A free miner is
briefly defined to be &ldquo;such as have lawfully worked at coal a year
and a day.&rdquo;&nbsp; A foreigner selling coal at Hereford for less than
13s. per ton was to be summoned, or abide the consequences of a general
&ldquo;forbid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Should there be at any time more than a
sufficiency of coal for the trade on the Wye, the barge-owners were to
employ the services of the miners, or be fined according to their
wages.&nbsp; A horse-load to the Wye was fixed at 2 cwt. and a quarter for
6d., ten such making a ton, to be weighed, if required, under a forfeit of
2s. 6d.&nbsp; Miners beneath the wood were bound to sell not less than a
cwt. of coal for 4d.; 3 bushels of smith&rsquo;s coal for 5d.; and 1 bushel
of lime coal for 1d. at the pit.&nbsp; No team was to be served with less
than 2 cwt. nor more than 21 cwt., to be weighed, if desired, or forfeit
&pound;5.&nbsp; This Order constituted Richard Clarke and Edward Tomkins
Machen, Esqrs., free miners, and exhibits at the end the penmanship of only
18 of the jury, all the rest merely making their marks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>We
now arrive at the <i>seventeenth</i> or last &ldquo;Order&rdquo; issued by
the Mine Law Court.&nbsp; It dates 22nd October, 1754, and sat at the
Speech House, before Maynard Colchester and Thomas James, Esqrs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It records the election to free-minerships of the Right Honble. George

</blockquote>
<p>So full a list of persons of position and influence as this Order
exhibits, lending their names to the Free Miners&rsquo; Society, indicates
the existence of considerable importance in that body; and yet this was the
last Court having forty-eight free miners on the jury whose proceedings
have been preserved, the fact being that they failed to agree in their
verdicts, and then gentlemen refused to attend, owing, it is said, to the
violent quarrels and disputes which arose between foreigners possessed of
capital, who now began to be admitted to the works, and the free
miners.&nbsp; It is also reported that the decisions of the court were
seldom observed, no Act of Parliament having passed to render them
valid.&nbsp; The former protective distance between one mine and another
was increased from 500 to 1000 yards of any levels, and enforced by a
&pound;5 penalty.&nbsp; The order concludes with directing that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The water-wheel engine at the Orling Green, near Broadmoor, be
taken to be a level to all intents and purposes.&rdquo;&nbsp; This machine
was evidently the first of its kind erected in the Forest, as was also the
steam-engine which superseded it, each manifesting the improvements going
on in the method of working the mines.&nbsp; The <!-- page 72--><a

this final &ldquo;Order&rdquo; show twenty-five marksmen, and twenty-three
names written by their possessors.</p>

<p>The Benefaction-Boards of the Gloucester Infirmary record, in reference
to this period, the following particular:&mdash;&ldquo;A gracious
benefaction from his Majesty King George II. of 9,200 feet of rough oak
timber from the Forest of Deane.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1758&ndash;1800.</h2>
<p class="headingsummary">Mr. John Pitt suggested 2,000 acres to be
planted&mdash;The Forest surveyed&mdash;Great devastations and
encroachments&mdash;The roads&mdash;Act of 1786, appointing a Commission of
Inquiry&mdash;New plantations recommended&mdash;Messrs. Drivers employed to
report on the Forest&mdash;Corn riots&mdash;Mitcheldean market.</p>
<p>Reverting to the state of the woods and timber in the Forest, it appears
that ere this the old enclosures had been thrown open, the trees planted
early in this century having attained to considerable size, and some parts
so far cleared as to suggest the formation of new plantations.&nbsp; In
1758 John Pitt, Esq., then Surveyor-General of Woods, &amp;c., proposed to
the Treasury that 2,000 acres should be enclosed, which was ordered to be
done accordingly; but probably it was executed in part only, since Mr. Pitt
was removed from his office five years afterwards, when a survey of the
timber was made, and it was computed that there were 27,302 loads of timber
fit for the navy, 16,851 loads of about sixty years&rsquo; growth, and
20,066 loads dotard and decaying.&nbsp; To this period also belongs the
first opening of the old Fire-engine colliery, or Orling Green coal-work,
galed to &ldquo;foreigners,&rdquo; but subsequently conveyed by them at
different times in shares to various persons, including the gaveller, by
whom the first fire-engine was put up about 1777, a date also memorable as
being the one on which the Court of Free Miners wholly ceased to act.</p>
<p>Mr. John Pitt was reinstated in 1763, and represented that he found
&ldquo;great spoil had been committed, and great quantities of wood and
timber, amounting in value to &pound;3,255, cut by order of Sir Edmund
Thomas, the late Surveyor-General, without warrant.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <!--
page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>year
following, Mr. Pitt presented a second memorial to the Government,
proposing that 2,000 acres more should be taken in, at an estimated cost of
&pound;2,077.&nbsp; The usual warrant was issued for the purpose,
authorizing wood-sales to that amount, although the expense ultimately came
to &pound;3,676. 5s. 6&frac12;d.</p>
<p>The attention of Parliament was directed at this time to the best means
of increasing the supply of timber to the Royal dockyards.&nbsp; A
committee formed for investigating the matter produced the clearest
evidence of decrease of navy timber throughout the kingdom, to the extent
of at least two-thirds within the last forty years, according to the
experience of thirty different dealers.&nbsp; The annual amount of such
timber supplied from Dean Forest is stated to have averaged at this time
about 2,000 loads.&nbsp; Probably the most correct view of the disposition
of the woods, plantations, &amp;c., and of the district in general, is
afforded by Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s map of the county of Gloucester, published
in 1777.&nbsp; It indicates the enclosures formed since the beginning of
the century, as well as a considerable extent of woodland; indeed we know,
from the return made to a Parliamentary survey taken in 1783, that the
Forest contained 90,382 oak-trees, amounting to 95,043 loads, besides
17,982 beech-trees, in which were 16,492 loads; to protect which more
effectually, Mr. Pitt instituted the place of &ldquo;watch-man,&rdquo;
attaching to it a dwelling-house on Oaken Hill, and a small quantity of
land, with a salary of &pound;10, and any fines or rewards obtained on the
conviction of timber stealers.</p>
<p>Very mischievous devastations and encroachments were nevertheless still
continued.&nbsp; For instance, Mr. Slade, the purveyor to the navy, stated
to the Treasury, that &ldquo;he had discovered and was informed of most
shameful depredations of the oak timber, which was cut every day by persons
living round the Forest; and that for some years it had been the custom to
steal the body of the tree in the night, and cut it into cooper&rsquo;s
wares, leaving the top part on the spot, which the keepers took as their
perquisite; and that whole trees <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>were conveyed every spring tide to Bristol; and
that when he was at Gatcomb, in one day there were five or six teams came
with timber, planks, and knees, winter-felled, and other timber, among
which were several useful pieces for ships of fifty and sixty-four
guns.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was also stated by Mr. Pitt, the Surveyor-General,
that &ldquo;everything in his power had been done to put a stop to them,
but that the offenders had become so desperate and daring as to bid
defiance to his deputies, and render every attempt of his in a summary way
totally ineffectual,&rdquo; adding that, &ldquo;not long before, a number
of persons in disguise had openly cut down two large timber-trees at
Yorkley, in Dean Forest, and wounded several keepers who attempted to
oppose them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Colchester likewise informed the Government
that &ldquo;the greatest part of the fine timber this Forest has been so
famous for has been cut down, and the large and extensive tract of land
formerly covered with the noblest timber is now become a barren waste and
heath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Blunt, the deputy-surveyor, also reports, in allusion to this
period, that, &ldquo;having formerly pulled down and destroyed many
cottages, fences, and enclosures, he had latterly been obliged to desist,
fearing his life and property were endangered by the repeated threats and
insults of the encroachers and their party.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds that
&ldquo;about 1000 loads of oak timber were annually being felled for the
use of the miners, of which at least one-fifth part was fit for naval
purposes; and that the great waste, spoil, and destruction of timber and
wood on the Forest is and hath been occasioned by an improper application
of the timber delivered to the miners for the use of their works, one-half
of which would have been more than sufficient, for that he had frequently
seized large quantities of offal timber, and such other timber as the
miners could not use in their works; and in particular that on or about the
28th of January, 1783, he seized and took 586 feet of oak-timber, and more
than 200 cleft pieces of oak, called kibbles, from one George Martin, who
acknowledged <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>that they had been stolen.&nbsp; He had also seized at the
Fire-Engine in the Forest between two and three waggonloads of timber, hewn
up and converted by the colliers into cooper&rsquo;s wares for market, as
the neighbourhood, being a great cinder country, would
require.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joseph Pyrke, Esq., a verderer and deputy-constable,
further stated that &ldquo;numberless encroachments, enclosing one, two, or
three acres, were taken in for gardens by the idle poor, and also by people
in good circumstances,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;nothing short of a capital
offence would ever preserve the remaining timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We obtain information on the subject of pit-timber from Mr.
Hartland&rsquo;s evidence before the Parliamentary Commissioners.&nbsp; He
says that &ldquo;the sorts of wood or timber delivered to the miners were
oak and beech, and none other; chiefly oak in the summer, more pits being
sunk in the summer than in the winter, and the keepers having the bark;
more beech is allowed in the winter than oak.&nbsp; But oak timber is
necessary, and is always allowed, for sinking the pits, and for making what
the miners call the gateway, or gangway, from the body of coal to the pit,
and also for the gutters in the levels, for draining off the water; but
beech, birch, orle, holly, or any other kind of wood, would serve for the
purpose of getting coal, and supporting the earth after the coal is taken
away, but none is ever delivered to them but oak and beech.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
goes on to say that &ldquo;the evil of the colliers misapplying the timber
served to them by the keepers could only be remedied by refusing it for the
future to such parties as had been detected therein.&nbsp; Fining them was
found impracticable, owing to the difficulty of proving the timber to have
been the King&rsquo;s, without which proof the justices could hardly
act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rewards of &pound;20, and in gross cases of &pound;50, were offered to
any persons making a discovery whereby any of the offenders should be
convicted; but without much effect, for the sufficient reason, as stated in
the official report of 1788, that the resident officers derived advantages
from the continuance of the abuse.&nbsp; Thus the <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Deputy-Surveyor took as
perquisites the tops of all timber rejected by the navy, as well as of all
stolen timber; all trees found felled by wood-stealers; one moiety of the
cord-wood made from the offal-wood of timber delivered to the miners, and
of stolen timber, besides from four pence to six pence for every tree
felled for the use of the miners; whereby his salary was raised from
&pound;50 to &pound;500 a year.&nbsp; It was much the same with the six
keepers, who received one shilling on every order for delivery of timber to
the miners or colliers; the moiety of all offal-wood of timber cut for the
miners; the moiety of all cord-wood of stolen timber; all lengths or pieces
of trespass, and the bark of timber delivered to the miners, stolen timber
called kibbles, and of all stolen timber found within their respective
walks, by means of which their stipends were increased &pound;100 a year
each.</p>
<p>Mr. Miles Hartland, the assistant-deputy-surveyor, in his examination,
on the 15th of May, 1788, before the Dean Forest Commissioners, also stated
that &ldquo;he believed the cottages and encroachments in the Forest have
nearly doubled within the last forty years.&nbsp; The persons who inhabit
the cottages are chiefly poor labouring people who are induced to seek
habitations in the Forest for the advantages of living rent free, and
having the benefit of pasturage for a cow or a few sheep, and of keeping
pigs in the woods; but many encroachments have been made by people of
substance.&nbsp; The cattle of the cottagers are impounded when the Forest
is driven by the keepers, as all other cattle are; and when the owners take
them from the pound, paying the usual fees to the keepers, they turn them
again into the Forest, having no other means of maintaining them.&nbsp; The
greater number of the cottagers are from the neighbouring parishes; but
there are also a great many from Wales, and from various parts of England,
remote from the Forest.&nbsp; They are detrimental to the Forest by cutting
wood for fuel, and for building huts, and making fences to the patches
which they enclose from the Forest; by keeping pigs, <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>sheep, &amp;c., in the
Forest all the year, and by stealing timber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of the Forest roads, on which &pound;11,631 3s. 10d. had been
expended within the preceding twenty-five years, Mr. Hartland stated that
&ldquo;the principal were the road from Mitcheldean to Monmouth, and from
Little Dean to Coleford.&nbsp; These two are public high roads, not
necessary or useful to the Forest, but rather detrimental to it by
affording the readier means to convey away the coal in waggons and carts,
in which timber has sometimes been found concealed.&nbsp; Besides the
above, there are several roads leading from the Forest to Newland,
Coleford, and St. Briavel&rsquo;s, which have been kept in repair at the
charge of the Forest, but are of no use to it&mdash;rather the
contrary.&nbsp; The only road now used for conveying the navy timber is the
Purton Road, which is the most convenient for carriage to the water side
from all parts of the Forest except the Chesnuts in Edge Hills, and the Lea
Bailey; but there is no navy timber now in either of these places except
the Lea Bailey.&nbsp; If the repairing of the public roads at the charge of
the Forest were to be discontinued, the public would be obliged to put up
turnpike gates on the roads, and collect tolls for repairing them, as in
other parts of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parts of the Forest which Mr. Hartland described as being
&ldquo;bare of timber and yet fittest to be enclosed as being of a very
proper soil, were Hazle Hill and Edge Hills, including Tanner&rsquo;s Hill,
Green Bottom and Greenhill, Badcock&rsquo;s Bailey and Chesnuts, East and
West Haywood, part of Great Staple Edge, Meezeyhurst, Howbeach and Putmage,
Buckhall, Moor and Bradley Hill, Bircham Dingles and Mason&rsquo;s Tump,
Blakevellet, Breames Eves and Howell Hill, the Perch and Coverham, Great
and Little Bourts, the Lea Bailey, Bailey Hill and Lining Wood, Great and
Little Berry, Pluds and Smithers Tump, Blackthorn Turf and Serridge,
Kensley&rsquo;s Ridge, Daniel Moor and Beechenhurst, &lsquo;forming in
short twenty plantations,&rsquo; which might, he thinks, be enclosed by a
ditch about <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>3 feet deep and 3&frac12; wide, with a quick hedge planted upon
the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detection of the various abuses which the above extracts exhibit
constitutes the first fruit of the enactment of the 26th George III. (1786)
for appointing commissioners to inquire into the state of the woods,
forests, &amp;c., of the Crown, and to report thereon, adding such
observations as should occur to them for their future management and
improvement.</p>
<p>Upwards of &pound;2,000 worth of timber out of the Forest was granted,
26th of April, 1786, towards building a gaol in Gloucester, as well as a
penitentiary house and houses of correction within the county, at a total
cost of &pound;30,000, upon the plea that the old castle, on the site of
which the gaol was to be built, belonged to the King, and also that one of
the houses of correction was to be erected within the Forest, whereby the
rights of the Crown would be supported.&nbsp; The execution of this grant
required 1,690 trees.</p>
<p>The gentlemen appointed to act in the commission above named were, Sir
Charles Middleton, John Call, Esq., and Arthur Holdsworth, Esq., who
forthwith proceeded to collect information on the history and management of
the Forest of Dean, as well as the claims and usages of the mining
population.&nbsp; Their report, being the third of the series, was
published on the 3rd of June, 1788.&nbsp; Commencing with an introduction
respecting the Royal Forests generally, it proceeds to this Forest in
particular, &ldquo;as being in proportion to its extent by far the most
valuable and the most proper for a nursery of naval timber,&rdquo; and
refers first to the origin and results of the important Act of the 20th
Charles II.; then to the abuses which have since crept in, with their
disastrous effects; and, thirdly, to the best way of settling the claims of
commoners, and how to render this Forest a very valuable nursery of timber
for the royal navy.</p>
<p>All particulars bearing upon the two former heads have been as fully
stated in the preceding pages of this work as circumstances permitted:
under the last head, <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>the suggestions of the commissioners amounted
briefly to this,&mdash;that, agreeably to the plan begun about the year
1638, under the supervision of Sir Baynham Throckmorton, a commission
should be created to superintend the enclosing of about 18,000 acres.&nbsp;
The most wooded parts of the Forest were to be selected, and where the soil
was best fitted for the growth of timber, avoiding the coalworks, and
leaving out all necessary roads to be made and kept in repair by turnpikes,
unless required for the carriage of timber only; the rights of commoners
were to be discharged by allotting an equitable extent of land suitable for
pasture, and the colliers to pay for all pit timber; the deer were to be
disposed of, as demoralizing the inhabitants and injuring the young wood;
and lastly, the commissioners recommended ejecting the cottagers who had
established themselves in the Forest, as often before, in defiance of
authority, and who numbered upwards of 2,000, occupying 589 cottages,
besides 1,798 small enclosures containing 1,385 acres.&nbsp; As to
defraying the cost of executing the above works, the commissioners
recommended the sale of about 440 acres of detached pieces of Crown land
adjoining the Forest, and if necessary dotard and decayed trees, or such as
would never become fit for naval use.</p>
<p>The surveyors, Messrs. A. and W. Driver, calculated the fencing,
planting, and keeping up the contemplated enclosures, for the whole of the
ensuing 100 years, at &pound;564,330, by which time the timber would
probably be worth &pound;10,680,473, and yield an annual net revenue of
&pound;52,052.&nbsp; According to the Report of these gentlemen, the Forest
then contained about 24,000 oak-trees averaging one and a half loads each,
and 24,000 oak-trees measuring about half a load each, not including
unsound trees, of which there were many, besides a considerable number of
fine large beech as well as young growing trees.&nbsp; The principal stock
of young timber, from which any expectation could be formed, was in the Lea
Bailey and Lining Woods, which were in general well stocked, and would
produce a <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>considerable quantity of fine timber, if properly fenced and
protected from the depredations of plunderers.&nbsp; As to the names,
extent, and character of the plantations then existing, they report as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Great Enclosure</i>, which contained 743 acres 35 poles,
was begun to be made about twelve years ago, with post and rail; but before
the whole was completed, a great part was taken away, and nothing now
remains but the bank; there are no young trees of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stonedge Enclosure</i> was made about twelve years ago; it
contained 125 acres 1 rood 10 poles, and was fenced with a dry stone wall,
which is, for the most part, destroyed; there are a great many thorns and
hollies, with some very fine large oaks, but no young timber of any kind
coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Coverham Enclosure</i>, which contained 350 acres 2 roods 34
poles, was made about fifteen years ago, part with a dry stone wall, and
part post and rails; nothing but the bank now remains.&nbsp; There was a
great quantity of young timber, particularly birch, in this enclosure,
which is nearly all destroyed in consequence of the fences being pulled
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Serridge Enclosure</i> was made about twelve years ago.&nbsp;
It contained 409 acres 3 roods 20 poles, and was fenced with a dry stone
wall, of which but little remains, being quite open in many parts; there
are no young trees of any sort, and but few old trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Heywood Enclosure</i> contained 715 acres 3 roods 38 poles,
and was made about ten years ago, part with a dry stone wall, and part
pales; very few traces remain, and in some parts none at all.&nbsp; We have
been informed that great part of the wall was pulled down, or fell, before
the whole was completed, and the pales carried away by waggons, &amp;c.,
soon after they were put up; and from its present appearance it is evident
no advantage has been derived from this enclosure, as there are no young
trees in any part of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>The three following enclosures, containing together 323 acres 1
rood 33 poles, are all that remain enclosed and in good repair, except the
Buckholt Enclosure mentioned last, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stapleage Enclosure</i>, containing 183 acres 1 rood 3 poles,
has been made about five years, part with dry stone wall, and part dead
hedge; in general in good repair.&nbsp; In some parts of it there are a few
small oak and beech plants, and also a few large oaks and
beeches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Speech House Enclosure</i>, containing 5 acres 6 poles, was
made four years ago by the Deputy Surveyor, and planted with acorns which
have produced some young oaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Birchwood Enclosure</i>, containing 135 acres 24 poles, has
been made about five years, part with dead hedge and part dry stone wall,
which in general is in good repair; there are but few young oaks coming
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buckholt Enclosure</i>, which contains 352 acres 3 roods 20
poles, has been made about eighty years, the greatest part with a stone
wall, the rest hedge and ditch.&nbsp; The fences of this enclosure have of
late years been kept in good repair.&nbsp; There are some very fine large
oaks in it, but in general it contains a great quantity of fine young
beech.&nbsp; There are also some oak-trees of about ten or fifteen
years&rsquo; growth, and young oaks are coming up from acorns which have
been set in vacant places.&nbsp; A few Weymouth pines have also been
planted in this enclosure, which grow very well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total acreage of these enclosures was 3,220 acres 6 poles, and their
position is shown pretty accurately by Mr. Taylor in his map of the
county.&nbsp; Messrs. Driver&rsquo;s report also informs us that there were
now 589 houses, 1,798 pieces of land encroached from the open Forest,
comprising 1,385 acres 3 roods 21 poles, thus distributed in the six
&ldquo;walks:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Upwards of seventeen different Reports on the condition of &ldquo;the
Forest and Land Revenues of the Crown&rdquo; were made to Parliament by the
Commission of 1788, a fact which will partly explain the delay which took
place in carrying out the plans recommended in the Commissioners&rsquo;
Third Report with reference to the Forest of Dean.&nbsp; The chief
improvements effected were in the roads, under an Act passed in the year
1795, for mending, widening, and altering the existing roads, and making
new ones through the Forest to places adjoining, in the parishes of
Newland, Lydney, and Awre.&nbsp; Mr. John Fordyce, now the
Surveyor-General, alluding to the subject in his Report, dated 1797, says,
that an arrangement had been made with the principal inhabitants in the
neighbourhood, whereby the cost of keeping up the roads was to be met by
means of turnpikes, the Crown constructing them in the first instance.</p>
<p>The year 1795 is associated with the disturbances commonly called, even
now, for they are not forgotten, &ldquo;the Bread Riots.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
arose from the circumstance of the foresters being mainly dependent upon
the adjacent farms for their corn, but which was now, owing to war, largely
bought up by the Government, mostly at Gloucester and Bristol, for the
supply of the army and <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>navy.&nbsp; Hence the inhabitants of the Forest
district were left destitute of those supplies which the miners and
colliers of the Forest considered they were entitled to, in return for the
fuel which they furnished to the farmers.</p>
<p>The following extracts from the contemporary numbers of &lsquo;The
Gloucester Journal&rsquo; minutely relate the acts of violence which
ensued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday morning, 30th October, 1795, as Mr. King&rsquo;s
waggon, of Bollitree, was bringing a load of barley to the Gloucester
Market, it was beset by a number of colliers from the Forest of Dean near
the Lea Line, who inquired what the bags contained, and when told that it
was barley, they cut the bags to examine; whilst this was passing, a
waggon, loaded with wheat, came up the hill belonging to Mr. Dobson, of
Harthill, in the parish of Weston, which was taken to in the same manner,
and both waggons with the grain were taken off to a place in the Forest of
Dean, called Drybrook, where the people divided the corn, and sent back the
waggons and horses to the owners.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next Saturday &ldquo;a
party of foresters, chiefly from the neighbourhood of Lidbrook, stopped a
waggon belonging to Mr. Prince, of Longhope, loaded with ninety-two bushels
of wheat, and lodged it in Ross Market-house, professedly with the
intention of selling it out on Monday morning at eight shillings per
bushel.&nbsp; A magistrate, however, reached Ross early on Monday, and,
accompanied by ten of the Essex Light Dragoons, saw the grain reloaded into
Mr. Prince&rsquo;s waggon, and sent it off under their escort.&nbsp; In
about an hour upwards of sixty foresters collected together, and set off in
pursuit of the waggon.&nbsp; The magistrate followed on horseback, and at
the Lea he came up with the waggon, which he sent on, and ordered the
cavalry to stop till the approach of the mob.&nbsp; They soon made their
appearance, and being at first somewhat refractory, the ringleader was
taken into custody; when, after the most persuasive remonstrances of this
very active magistrate, and the patient forbearance of the soldiery, they
were at last prevailed upon to give up <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the desperate idea of
rescuing the grain, and returned peaceably to Ross.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A reputed highwayman, and noted deerstealer, named William Stallard,
living on the Upper Purlieu, above the Hawthorns, is stated to have been
the instigator of these outrages, and others of a similar kind on Mr.
Prince&rsquo;s flour-mill at Longhope.&nbsp; His lawless career, however,
brought him to the gallows at Gloucester for horse-stealing, at the age of
forty, on the 16th August, 1800, as appears by the records of that
gaol.&nbsp; The decline of the market in Mitcheldean is said to date from
the above disturbances, which naturally deterred the neighbouring farmers
from sending their grain thither for sale. <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a></p>
<p>Nor were the bread riots confined to the northern side of the Forest, as
upon &ldquo;the evening of the same day, November 9th, many persons
assembled at Hanstell, in the parish of Awre, in this county, where a
vessel belonging to Eversham, and bound to Bristol with a cargo of pease,
oil, flour, leather, and wheat, was waiting for the tide.&nbsp; About
twenty men boarded her, examined the lading, and, upon discovering the
flour, gave loud huzzas, when the bank was instantly covered with their
comrades, who had many horses in waiting, with which they proceeded to
carry off the flour, though the trowmen (unable to defend the vessel, and
menaced with instant destruction) had offered to sell it to them at a
reasonable price.&nbsp; About 7 o&rsquo;clock one of the trowmen contrived
to slip ashore, ran to Newnham, and sent off an express to Gloucester for
immediate military aid; but fortunately that assistance was nearer at
hand.&nbsp; In consequence of some apprehension of a disturbance <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>at Mitcheldean,
an officer, with a serjeant and ten file of the Essex Fencibles Cavalry,
had marched into the place early in the morning, and upon the arrival of
the express from Newnham instantly set forth for the scene of depredation,
under the command of Lieutenant Wood, and headed by Mr. Pyrke, a magistrate
of Little Dean.&nbsp; The freebooters fled in every direction, but five
men, named Thomas Yemm, Thomas Rosser, Richard Brain, George Marfell, and
John Meek, being the most active ringleaders, were apprehended, some in the
act of conveying away the flour upon packhorses, some had sacks of it upon
their shoulders, some were just landed from the vessel; and many were
busied on the bank, which was strewed with flour, dividing the sacks into
smaller quantities to render it more portable, for even women and children
were of the number.&rdquo;&nbsp; The five men already named were fully
committed on the following Tuesday to Gloucester Castle, there to be tried
at the Spring Assizes, being guarded thither by one hundred of the Surrey
Fencibles, who had arrived in Newnham at 3 o&rsquo;clock previously.&nbsp;
Shortly afterwards, the serjeant of the military, called out on this
occasion, was desperately bruised by a stone thrown at him by some
desperadoes as he was riding near Mitcheldean, and, on a subsequent
Thursday, some villains fired a piece loaded with slugs into the
bed-chamber of Mr. Pyrke.&nbsp; At the ensuing Assizes, Thomas Yemm and
Thomas Rosser were left for execution, which, although, from the excellent
character they previously bore, some gentlemen of the Forest, and of the
Grand Jury, interceded with his Majesty on their behalf, they underwent on
the 11th April, 1797, acknowledging the justice of their sentence.&nbsp;
The extraordinary scarcity, and consequent high price of provisions about
this time, were so acutely felt in this neighbourhood, that the Crown
distributed &pound;1,000 worth of grain amongst the distressed
Foresters.</p>

<p>There is a statement of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s relating to this Forest,
written about the year 1802, <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a> in which he says: &ldquo;Nothing in it can grow
self-sown, for the deer bark all the young trees.&nbsp; Vast droves of hogs
are allowed to go into the woods in the autumn, and if any fortunate acorn
escapes their search, and takes root, then flocks of sheep are allowed to
go into the Forest, and they bite off the tender shoot.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
speaks of &ldquo;a set of people called Forest free miners, who consider
themselves as having a right to dig for coal in any part they
please,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;trees which die of themselves are
considered as of no value to the Crown.&nbsp; A gentleman told me,&rdquo;
(he says,) &ldquo;that in shooting on foot (for on horseback it cannot be
seen, being hid by the fern, which grows a great height), the trees of
fifty years&rsquo; growth, fit for buildings, fencings, &amp;c., are cut
just above ground entirely through the bark, and in two years die,&rdquo;
so becoming a perquisite to the authorities.&nbsp; Lord Nelson calculated
that the Forest would sell for &pound;460,000.&nbsp; He forcibly concludes:
&ldquo;The reason why timber has of late years been so much <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>reduced has
been uniformly told me&mdash;that, from the pressure of the times,
gentlemen who had &pound;1000 to &pound;5000 worth of timber on their
estates, although only half grown (say fifty years of age), were obliged to
sell it to raise temporary sums&mdash;say to pay off legacies.&nbsp; The
owner cannot, however sorry he may feel to see the beauty of his place
destroyed, and what would be treble the value to his children annihilated,
help himself.&nbsp; It has struck me forcibly that if Government could form
a plan to purchase of such gentlemen the growing oak, it would be a
national benefit, and a great and pleasing accommodation to such growers of
oak as wish to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fordyce&rsquo;s second report, as Surveyor-General of the Land
Revenues of the Crown, appeared on the 14th of December, 1802; but neither
this nor his third, dated the 4th of March, 1806, says anything about the
Forest of Dean.&nbsp; In 1807 the free miners of the district held a
meeting, at which a resolution was passed, earnestly requesting the wardens
of the Forest to hold a Court of Mine Law, as soon as possible, with the
view of regulating the levels, pits, and engines.</p>
<p>Mr. Fordyce&rsquo;s fourth and final report appeared on the 6th of
April, 1809, but it only speaks of the Forest so far as related to the
lands called &ldquo;Whitemead Park,&rdquo; hitherto in the occupation of
Lord Berkeley, but whose lease would expire in January, 1808, and was
sought to be renewed.&nbsp; The Surveyor-General declined complying with
the request for renewal, upon the ground that the Park was unfavourably
situated for farming purposes, and that the buildings on it were in very
bad repair; whereas a large quantity of very fine timber, valued at
&pound;11,736, had grown up on the land, proving the excellence of the soil
for that purpose; besides which, it was situated in the midst of the
Forest, and Mr. Fordyce determined to plant the whole of it with oak at the
earliest opportunity.&nbsp; This circumstance appears to have stimulated
the Government to commence in good earnest the forming of plantations, in
accordance with the suggestions made in the Commissioners&rsquo; Report of
<!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>1788,
<a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89" class="citation">[89]</a>
which had been kept in view ever since, and as authorized by the old Acts
of the 20th of Charles II. c. 3, and 9 and 10 William III. c. 36.</p>
<p>The propriety, however, of acting upon these old enactments was now
doubted, as they had been so long overlooked or irregularly executed; and
hence the declaratory Act of the 48th of George III., c. 72, was passed in
1808, confirming the original power to enclose 11,000 acres, as well as
legalizing the enclosures of Buckholt, Stapledge, Birchwood, and Acorn
Patch, formed a few years previously, containing altogether 676 acres, and
making it felony to persist in breaking down any of the fences belonging to
the same.&nbsp; The above-named enclosures were the only ones then
existing.&nbsp; The Buckholt principally contained beech; Stapledge was
thinly stocked with oak, except on the north side, and there called Little
Stapledge, on which there was plenty; and Birchwood had some clusters of
natural young oaks scattered about it.&nbsp; The Acorn Patch was well
filled with thriving young oaks about 25 years old.&nbsp; The same Act
likewise directed that the contemplated plantations should be marked out
under the supervision of not less than six Commissioners, who were named as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The connexion with the Forest of two of these gentlemen, viz. Lord
Glenbervie as Surveyor-General, and Mr. Machen as Deputy-Surveyor, dates
from this period; and to their joint exertions, aided by the official
labours of Mr. Milne, his Lordship&rsquo;s excellent secretary, and at <!--
page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>length one
of the three Commissioners of Woods, &amp;c., the existing enclosures owe
their formation as well as their present promising condition; but
especially to Mr. Machen is the credit due, as being the result of his able
and conscientious management of the Forest for well nigh half a
century.</p>
<p>With a prospective reference to the plantations shortly to be made, the
most laudable pains were taken by Lord Glenbervie to ascertain the best
mode of planting and raising the young trees.&nbsp; He truly remarks that
&ldquo;the space of nearly 100 years must elapse before the success or
failure of any plan adopted in the cultivation and management of oak timber
for the navy can be clearly ascertained, during the whole of which time a
persevering attention and uniformity of system in the execution of the plan
adopted would be equally requisite, in fact through a succession perhaps of
three or four generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; His Lordship made extensive
inquiries whether acorns or plants should be first used, or rather some of
each; what was the best age and size for transplanting; if plants or trees
of any other kind should be set with them, or in places where oaks would
not thrive; at what distance apart should they be planted; ought the soil
to be cleared or dug, or how prepared; are the old trees to be removed, and
the stumps of oak or beech suffered to remain?</p>
<p>On the 23rd of July, 1808, the general principle agreed upon in these
respects was, &ldquo;to plant an intermixture of acorns and oak-trees, with
a very small proportion of Spanish chesnuts; so that, if either the acorns
or young oaks should succeed, a sufficient crop might be expected, and to
plant no trees of any other sorts, except in spots where it should be
thought that oaks would not grow, and which it might be necessary to
include, in order to avoid the expense of fencing, or for shelter in high
and exposed situations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first enclosures were planted
agreeably to this method, only afterwards it was found necessary to set
young oaks instead of acorns, few of these only coming up.</p>
<p>Lord Glenbervie also interested himself in some <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>experiments for testing
the transplanting of young trees of various ages, selecting Acorn Patch in
the centre of the Forest for the purpose.&nbsp; The annexed table, carried
on to 1846, gives the result:&mdash;</p>

<p>More as a satisfaction to the Government before making the new
plantations, than as a guide to the commissioners, most of whom knew the
Forest intimately, Messrs. Driver were now directed to examine the
condition and situation of the woods and woodlands, and to report
thereon.&nbsp; They began by numbering the timber trees in succession, and
had reached 1,000, when the proceedings were put a stop to, on account of
the consumption of time and money which such an elaborate plan was found to
involve, and they briefly reported that the Forest seemed to contain 22,882
loads of oak timber, that only one third of the existing enclosures were
fully stocked, and that encroachments were rapidly spreading.</p>
<p>On the 15th of September in the ensuing year, 1809, the first meeting of
the above-named commissioners was held at Newnham, when 2,000 acres in
various parts of the Forest were selected for planting, and such directions
given that the 240 acres of White Mead Park were actually planted this
season, just in time to afford Mr. Fordyce the satisfaction of living to
know that the good work of renewing the Forest with oak, in accordance with
his recommendation made <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>twenty years before, was in fact begun, for at
this date his useful life was brought to a close.</p>
<p>Referring to the list of licences granted by the Crown this year, 1809,
it appears that the first effort was now made to prepare the slag and
cinders from the iron furnaces for the use of the Bristol bottle-glass
manufacture, by reducing them to powder in a stamping mill, one of which
was erected at Park End by Messrs. Kear, under a licence dated 23rd of
September.&nbsp; To this year also is to be referred the introduction of
tramways by two companies, designated &ldquo;The Severn and Wye Railway
Company,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bullo Pill Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; The road
belonging to the former of them traverses the western valley of the Forest
from Lydney to Lydbrook, a distance of fourteen miles, and the latter the
eastern, but both communicating with the Severn, although at points six
miles apart.&nbsp; The licence for the line ascending from Bullo Pill
describes it as designed to extend up to the Churchway engine, seven miles
off.&nbsp; It was constructed under a private Act obtained by Sir James
Jelf and his partners.</p>
<p>In the course of the next year, <i>i.e.</i> 1810, the Enclosure
Commissioners authorized the construction of the following five
plantations:&mdash;</p>

<p>The planting of them was intrusted to Mr. Driver, upon his own plan,
which was to dig holes four feet apart every way, or 2,722 in an acre, and
to plant an acorn in every hole but the tenth, in it substituting an
oak-tree of five years old.&nbsp; The holes for the acorns were dug fifteen
inches square and nine inches deep; but those for the young trees were made
eighteen inches square and twelve inches deep.&nbsp; The acorns cost 8s.
per 1,000, <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>and the trees 70s. per 1,000.&nbsp; One tree out of every 100 was
a five years old Spanish chesnut.&nbsp; So that planting the enclosures in
this way cost about &pound;3 15s. per acre, and the seedlings about
&pound;4 5s., which Mr. Driver was to mend over, and to keep the plants
good for three years.&nbsp; The fences were to consist of a bank five feet
high, with a row of French furze at the top and bottom, or where
impracticable a dry wall instead.&nbsp; The most flourishing timber in the
Forest at this period appears to have been that growing on Church Hill,
averaging 73 trees to the acre, each tree containing 58 feet of
timber.&nbsp; The Severn and Wye Tramway, commenced last year, was extended
in this, with the addition of a line from Monmouth up to Howler&rsquo;s
Slade.</p>
<p>In 1811 only one plantation, viz. &ldquo;Crab-tree Hill,&rdquo;
comprising 372 acres 2 roods 34 poles, was formed, and planted similarly to
the last; but the Enclosure Commissioners set out a considerable extent of
land to be taken in and planted.&nbsp; On the 28th of November steam
engines were licensed to be erected at Birches Well, Ivy Moorhead,
&ldquo;the Independent,&rdquo; Upper Bilson, two at &ldquo;the Old
Engine,&rdquo; and two at &ldquo;No Fold.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the next year
also two steam engines were licensed to be put up at Churchway Colliery,
and a third at &ldquo;Strip-and-at-it&rdquo; Colliery.&nbsp; The following
enclosures were made in 1812, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>These enclosures were not planted, however, like the former ones; since,
from the exuberance of weeds, and the ravages of mice, &amp;c., that method
had failed, three-fourths of the acorns never appearing, and many of those
that did come up were too weak to make their <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>way through the other
more luxuriant growth that overwhelmed and choked them.&nbsp; But these
enclosures, according to a second agreement made with Mr. Driver, as
likewise all the future ones, were planted with seedling oaks instead of
acorns, care being taken to clear the holes once or twice, and only the
tenth trees were introduced as before.&nbsp; The Buckholt was planted with
three years old oaks, from the woodmen&rsquo;s nurseries.</p>
<p>The first general report of the Commissioners of Woods, &amp;c.,
appointed under the Acts of 34th George III., c. 75, and 50th George III.,

<p>It says little respecting this Forest, merely alluding to it in common
with the other royal forests, as fitted to take its place in supplying
timber to the navy, which required 88,659 loads annually, a quantity so
large as to be equivalent to 1,000 acres of oak a century old.&nbsp; In
their present state the Royal Forests could not supply a tenth part of this
amount, and would always be deficient unless 1,000 acres were planted every
year for the next 100 years, by which time the above quantity might be
annually felled.&nbsp; Ere this year ended, the Enclosure Commissioners
concluded their labours of setting out the rest of the 11,000 acres in Dean
Forest.</p>

<p>The last of them, being the largest in the Forest, was not regularly
planted, but left for the most part to natural growth.</p>
<p>It was during this year especially, but to a certain degree also in the
preceding and succeeding ones, that this Forest and the New Forest were
visited with an enormous number of mice.&nbsp; They appeared in all parts,
but particularly in Haywood enclosure, destroying a very large proportion
of the young trees, so much so that only four or five plants to an acre
were found uninjured by them.&nbsp; The roots of five years old oaks and
chesnuts were generally eaten through just below the surface of the ground,
or wherever their runs proceeded.&nbsp; Sometimes they were found to have
barked the young hollies round the bottom, or were seen feeding on the bark
of the upper branches.&nbsp; These mice were of two kinds, the common
long-tailed field mouse, and the short-tailed.&nbsp; There were about fifty
of these latter sort to one of the former.&nbsp; The long-tailed mice had
all white breasts, and the tail was about the same length as the body. <a
name="citation95"></a><a href="#footnote95" class="citation">[95]</a>&nbsp;
These were chiefly caught on the wet greens in the Forest, and the
short-tailed were caught both on the wet and dry grounds.</p>
<p>A variety of means were resorted to for their destruction, such as cats,
poisons, and traps, but with little success.&nbsp; A Mr. Broad, who had
been employed by the Admiralty, and had been successful, in killing the
rats and mice in the fleet, was sent down, and tried several plans, all of
which failed.&nbsp; At last, a miner living on Edge Hills, named Simmons,
came forward, and said <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>that he had often, when sinking wells or pits,
found mice fallen in, and dead, in consequence of their endeavours to
extricate themselves, and he had little doubt that the same plan would
succeed in the Forest.&nbsp; It was tried, and holes were dug over the
enclosures about two feet deep, and the same size across, and rather
hollowed out at the bottom, and at the distance of about twenty yards
apart, into which the mice fell, and were unable to get out again.&nbsp;
Simmons and others were employed, and paid by the numbers of tails which
they brought in, which amounted in the whole to more than 100,000.&nbsp; In
addition to this it may be mentioned that polecats, kites, hawks, and owls
visited the holes regularly, and preyed upon the mice caught in them; and a
small owl, called by Pennant, Strix passerina, never known in the Forest
before or since, appeared at that time, and was particularly active in
their destruction.&nbsp; The mice in the holes also ate each other.</p>
<p>Four more steam engines were allowed to be erected about the close of
this year at Palmer&rsquo;s Flat and at Hopewell.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the following year, we find that in 1815 the number of
plantations was increased by the addition of&mdash;</p>

<p>Two years before this time the Admiralty had called the attention of the
Commissioners of Woods, &amp;c., to the most proper means of improving the
durability of oak timber, which had always been supposed to be best secured
by its being felled in winter, although, owing to its involving the loss of
the bark, the practice had not become general.&nbsp; To avoid such loss it
was determined, on the 15th of March this year, that the bark should be
stripped in the spring from the <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>trees standing, leaving them to be felled in
the ensuing or some subsequent spring, five shillings per load being
allowed for the additional trouble occasioned thereby.&nbsp; But this
determination was not formed without careful investigation and
experiment.&nbsp; Thus in the previous year (1814) thirty trees were marked
and set apart in each of the Royal Forests, &ldquo;which were divided into
five classes: three of the classes were stripped standing, but with some
variety in method, and left to be felled in winter; the second class was
felled, but left with the bark on; and the third felled, and then
immediately afterwards stripped in the usual way.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the
results of these different methods are not stated.</p>
<p>Licences to erect machinery were granted in the preceding year to
Messrs. Kear for a waterwheel at Park End in connexion with a mill for
pounding slag from the iron furnaces, and to Mr. Mushet for a steam engine
at Deepfield, and to Mr. John Protheroe for an engine at Whitelay Colliery;
and in the present year two steam engines were licensed at Upper Bilson by
Mr. Thomas Bennett, and one at Smith&rsquo;s Folly by Mr. Glover.</p>
<p>In the course of the succeeding year (1816) the last of the enclosures,
as set out by the commissioners appointed under the Act of 1808, were
completed, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p>The second report of the Commissioners of Woods, dated the 18th of May,
and signed by Wm. Huskisson, Wm. Dacres Adams, Henry Dawkins, states
&ldquo;that 9,389 acres of this Forest had been enclosed and planted, the
remaining 1,611 acres, making up the 11,000, being partly fenced, and would
be shut in the next year, viz. 1816, making the total number of enclosures
upwards of thirty.&nbsp; Besides which 240 acres <!-- page 98--><a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>of Whitemead Park had
been appropriated (1809) to the growth of timber, as also 120 acres
adjoining the different lodges, as well as 120 acres of the open Forest,
where trees twenty-five or thirty feet high had been planted, and were
doing very well.&nbsp; The cost of these operations, since 1808, was
&pound;59,172 5s. 10d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this period belongs the interesting circumstance of the then Bishop
of Gloucester, the excellent Dr. Ryder, paying his first official visit to
the Forest, for the purpose of consecrating Christ Church at Berry
Hill.&nbsp; The building was commenced, in 1812, as a chapel schoolroom, by
the Rev. P. M. Procter, the Vicar of Newland, assisted by the Duke of
Beaufort, the Lord Bishop, and Mr. Ryder his secretary, aided by &pound;100
from the National Society, being the first grant made by it.&nbsp; But the
structure was enlarged to twice the original size previous to its
consecration.</p>
<p>The next year (1817) the Bishop had the satisfaction of being called
upon in the month of April to repeat his visit to the Forest, for the
purpose of dedicating the Church of the Holy Trinity, on Quarry Hill, to
divine worship, for which it was first used on the previous 5th of
February, having been commenced the summer before.&nbsp; Its erection was
principally accomplished by the exertions of the Rev. H. Berkin, assisted
by contributions from the Earl of Liverpool, the Right Hon. N. Vansittart,
the Duke of Beaufort, Lord Kenyon, Lord Calthorpe, W. Wilberforce, Esq.,
M.P., and other benevolent persons.&nbsp; The site, comprising five acres,
was given by the Crown.</p>
<p>On the 15th of May this year the purchase of Lord Viscount Gage&rsquo;s
estate, adjoining the Forest and the Wye, was concluded, as stated in the
Commissioners&rsquo; Report, which appeared on the 18th of June.&nbsp; It
contained 2,229 acres of wood, which, &ldquo;if preserved, would (they
said) very soon be stocked with a succession of trees of the first quality,
as they were of the most thriving description, the oldest being from sixty
to eighty years old.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole property contained 4,257 acres
15 poles, and, including all the timber <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>and underwood, with
certain forges, mills, limekilns, iron and tin works, was valued by the
referees at &pound;155,863 3s. 2d., the timber being prised at
&pound;61,624 4s.&nbsp; This agreement was confirmed by Act of Parliament,
57 George III., c. 97, which authorized the raising of the money by sales
of Crown property to the amount of &pound;101,945 6s. 3d., with the view of
enabling the purchase money to be paid by five equal yearly
instalments.&nbsp; A corn-mill, two forge-houses with appendages, the tolls
of the Coleford Market-house, and about 423 acres of arable or meadow land,
were sold for the most part at higher prices than were given for them,
leaving 2,925 acres for the growth of timber.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p99.jpg">
<img alt="Norman Capital in Staunton Church" src="images/p99.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On tracing the history of this property as far back as existing records
permit, it appears that &ldquo;the High Meadow Estate,&rdquo; although
naturally included in the district constituting the Crown property of the
Forest, had been at remote period detached from it as appears by the
perambulations of 28 Edward I., with which the bounds of the shires of
Gloucester and Monmouth here coincide.&nbsp; Its ancient village church,
partly of Norman architecture, and its still more antique font, apparently
Saxon, sufficiently attest the early location of inhabitants on the
spot.&nbsp; This estate constituted one of the ten bailiwicks of the Forest
as early as 10 Edward I. (1282), when it was held by John Walden, called
John de Staunton, by the service, as the Rev. T. Fosbroke has ascertained,
&ldquo;of carrying the King&rsquo;s bow <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>before him when he
came to hunt in the bailiwick, and by homageward and marchat,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;he had for his custody housbote, heybote, of every kind of tree
given or delivered by the King; all broken oaks, and all trees of every
sort thrown down by the wind.&rdquo;&nbsp; After passing through the
families of the Baynhams, Brains, Winters, and Halls, who purchased the
manor of English Bicknor early in the 17th century, it became by marriage
the property of Sir Thomas Gage, created Viscount Gage of Castle Island, in
the county of Kerry, and Baron Gage of Castlebar, in the county of Mayo,
September 14th, 1720.&nbsp; It must also be noticed, that licences were
issued this year for the erection of steam-engines at &ldquo;No Coal&rdquo;
and at &ldquo;Churchway Coal&rdquo; Mines.</p>

<p>The following minute and interesting account of the state of the several
plantations in the year 1818 is by permission abstracted from Mr.
Machen&rsquo;s private papers.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Buckholt (one of the older enclosures), he
observes&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The large timber in it has been cut, and parts of it planted with
young oaks, obtained from places where they had sprung up spontaneously,
but it is still imperfectly stocked.&nbsp; Stapledge (another of <!-- page
101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>the earlier
plantations) has been filled up by transplanting from the thick parts, and
is tolerably well stocked on the whole.&nbsp; Birchwood (the third of the
previous enclosures) has been planted in the vacant parts, and is fully
stocked and very flourishing.&nbsp; From the Acorn Patch (the last of the
old plantations) a large quantity of young oaks have been transplanted into
the open parts of the Forest and the upper part of Russell&rsquo;s
Enclosure.&nbsp; The trees drawn out are thriving, and many of them grow
faster than the trees remaining in the Acorn Patch.&nbsp; There is a great
quantity of holly and other underwood scattered on the parts where the
trees are planted, and which serves for shelter and protection, and the
soil is very good.&nbsp; The trees, though never transplanted before, came
up with bunches of fibrous roots; and though of so large a size, being from
10 to 25 ft. high, scarcely any of them failed.&nbsp; Several experiments
were tried as to pruning closely, pruning a little, and not at all; and it
appears that those pruned sufficiently to prevent the wind from loosening
the roots answer best, although many of those which were reduced to bare
poles, and had their heads cut off, are now sending up vigorous leading
shoots, and have every appearance of becoming fine timber: those unpruned
did not succeed at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alluding to the earthen banks, with
which the plantations were mostly surrounded, Mr. Machen observes that
&ldquo;In most parts they appear to succeed very well, and the furze on the
top of them grows very luxuriantly; but in some places, and those where the
bank of mould has accumulated by being washed there in floods, the banks
are mouldering, and in the last two years hawthorn-quick has been planted
in those parts, and now looks very flourishing.&nbsp; There has not been a
good year of acorns, that is, where a quantity have ripened in the Forest,
since the commencement of the plantations until the present, and the trees
are now loaded, and with every prospect of ripening.&nbsp; The young trees
in all the new enclosures are looking remarkably well this year, and some
of them have made shoots so long that they more resemble willows than
oaks.&nbsp; The six first-named enclosures, in addition to the acorns and
five years old oaks, have had the same quantity of five years old oaks
planted in addition, in lieu of the mending over, viz. 270 on an acre; but
there are parts of all these, and almost the whole of Crab-tree Hill and
Haywood, which suffered not only from the failure of the acorns, but from
the ravages made by the mice, that will require to be filled up as soon as
there is a stock of plants sufficient for the purpose.&nbsp;
Russell&rsquo;s Enclosure is left to nature: only 10,000 Spanish chesnuts
have been planted in it, and some young oaks from the Acorn Patch at the
north end.&nbsp; There is a good deal of large timber over the whole,
particularly the south and centre parts, and a vast quantity of natural
young oaks sprung up in the neighbourhood of the large trees.&nbsp; The
fern has been cut to relieve and encourage them for the last three
years.&nbsp; The Lea Bailey Copse (north) consists of young copsewood well
stored with oaks, growing on their own butts.&nbsp; The Lea Bailey Copse
(south) has more large timber in it: this has not been regularly planted,
but <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>some trees have been transplanted from the thick parts of the
north copse, and from the woodmen&rsquo;s nurseries.&nbsp; The lower Lea
Bailey Enclosure has a considerable quantity of growing timber in it, and a
large quantity of young oaks springing up.&nbsp; No planting has been done
here.&nbsp; The fencing round these consists of a large ditch and bank, and
a dead hedge at top, with hawthorn-quick planted within.&nbsp; The hedge
having stood three years is decayed, and another will be required this
year, which it is expected will last until the quick becomes a fence.&nbsp;
The addition to the Buckholt of about fifteen acres was planted with 3
years old oaks from the woodmen&rsquo;s nurseries, and looks very
thriving.&nbsp; All the other enclosures were planted with seedlings and
tenth trees, according to the second agreement with Mr. Driver, in 1812,
13, 14, and 15, and are this year looking very well.&nbsp; Parts of all the
enclosures will require mending over, but I should think more than half are
sufficiently stocked with oaks well established, and that will require no
further attention until they want thinning.&nbsp; On the high land of
Haywood, Edge Hills, and Ruerdean Hill, firs and a mixture of other trees
have been planted, and are thriving and growing fast, particularly on
Ruerdean Hill, where the Scotch and larch take the lead.&nbsp; Firs,
&amp;c., have also been planted in the wet and bad parts of most of the
other enclosures, and succeed.&nbsp; The nurseries we have in cultivation
are the Bourts, 161 acres; Yew-tree Brake, about 5 acres; Ell Wood, 11
acres; and about 26 in the Vallets, or middle, and Sallow Vallets
Nurseries, previously occupied by Mr. Driver.&nbsp; In these there are now
about four millions of young oaks, three, two, and one year old, and about
600,000 firs and other trees of different sorts.&nbsp; The plants in
Whitemead Park are thriving very well in all parts which are situated at a
distance from the brook, but near to it they are very thin, stunted, and
unhealthy, and are constantly killed down by spring frosts.&nbsp; Ash and
fir trees have been planted amongst them, but with little success at
present.&nbsp; The principal part of the large timber now in the Forest is
about Park End, on Church Hill, Ivy More Head, Russell&rsquo;s Enclosure,
Park End Lodge Hill, and at the Lea Bailey.&nbsp; That at the Bailey
appears younger, and some of it shook by frost, and rather drawn up by
standing too thick.&nbsp; The timber about Park End is very fine, and I
should suppose from 150 to 200 years old.&nbsp; There is a considerable
quantity of young oak, from 15 to 40 years old, about Tanner&rsquo;s Hill,
&amp;c., near Gun&rsquo;s Mills, on the outside of Edge Hill Enclosure, and
some within it in the lower part.&nbsp; Chesnuts Enclosure is covered with
hazel, that was cut down when the oak was planted, and is now growing up
with the young oaks and chesnuts, both of which are more rapidly growing in
this enclosure than in any other; a double quantity of chesnuts are planted
in this enclosure.&nbsp; There are scarcely any natural trees in the Forest
but oak and beech; birch springs up spontaneously in every enclosure, and
overruns the whole Forest.&nbsp; The few ash trees look scrubbed and
unthrifty.&nbsp; Since the year 1809, 14,260 oak trees containing 14,546
loads of timber have been felled, viz. 11,322 trees <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>for the navy, and
2,938 sold by auction.&nbsp; About 50 trees, containing about 50 loads,
have been blown down or stolen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year, 1818, Mr. Trotter obtained the permission of the Crown to
erect steam engines at Vallets Level and Howler&rsquo;s Slade, and in the
following year the first corn mill was constructed at Cinderford, by Mr.
Brace, out of an old water-wheel, and the adjoining buildings.&nbsp; In the
year 1819 also, through the exertions of the Rev. H. Poole, the small
chapel at Coleford, erected there in the reign of Queen Anne, was taken
down, and a building more equal to the religious wants of the place was
erected, and duly set apart for Christian worship, by Bishop Ryder, on the
18th of January, 1821.</p>
<p>The Third Triennial Report of the Commissioners of Woods was issued on
the 18th of June, 1819.&nbsp; It states that three portions of land had
been granted in trust for church purposes to the Lord Bishop of Gloucester,
Lord Calthorpe, and the Right Honourable Nicolas Vansittart, one piece
being attached to Christ Church, Berry Hill, a second to Holy Trinity
Church, and the third for a proposed church at Cinderford.&nbsp; It also
affirms that the whole of the 11,000 acres specified in the Acts for
enclosing the Forest had been taken in and planted, and that the
plantations were generally in a very flourishing state, comprising with the
recent purchases 14,335 acres, the whole of which lands were, from the
nature of the soil and the conveniences of water-carriage, probably better
adapted for that purpose than any other tract of land in the kingdom lying
together and of equal extent.&nbsp; The report concludes by alluding to the
efforts which the commissioners had been making to induce such parties as
occupied encroachments on the Forest to accept leases for thirty-one years,
at an almost nominal rent, with the view of effecting the ultimate
restoration of these lands to the Crown, but regrets that so liberal a
proposal had been refused by nearly all; nevertheless further steps were
about being taken in the matter.</p>
<p>The following particulars relating to this period are <!-- page 104--><a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>abstracted from Mr.
Machen&rsquo;s Memoranda:&mdash;&ldquo;29th May, 1819.&nbsp; The frost was
so severe that the verdure around White Mead, and throughout all the low
parts of the Forest, was entirely destroyed.&nbsp; There was not a green
leaf left on any oak or beech, large or small, and all the shoots of the
year were altogether withered.&nbsp; The spruce and silver firs were all
injured: in short all trees but Scotch fir and poplar suffered
severely.&mdash;August 10th.&nbsp; The plantations had recovered from the
effects of the frost&mdash;the oak more effectually than the beech, and had
made more vigorous and thriving shoots than I ever saw.&nbsp; We measured
several shoots in Serridge and Birchwood more than five feet long, and one
in the Bailey Copse seven feet.&nbsp; We measured an oak planted in
Whitemead Park near to the W. hedge, and in the second field planted below
the house, seventeen feet six inches high: Lord Glenbervie was
present.&nbsp; Shutcastle in the upper part, and the eastern part of
Serridge, were looking best of all the new plantations, though all appear
in a very thriving state this year.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the same source we
learn that Ellwood, purchased from Colonel Probyn, and containing 110
acres, was planted this year.&nbsp; The holes were dug four feet apart in
rows, and five feet between the rows.&nbsp; The trees planted were 30,000
Scotch firs, 1,600 pineasters, 3,600 larch, 6,000 Spanish chesnuts, 120,000
oaks of three and four years old, and 4,500 seedling oaks planted by way of
experiment in one corner of the large field on the south side of Ellwood,
and with no large plants amongst them.&nbsp; A few of the enclosures had
oaks planted in them also, viz.-</p>

<p>Under the usual official permission, the Howler Slade Colliery was
connected, by a tramway 350 yards in length, with the Severn and Wye
Railways at Cannop, and Mr. J. Scott was permitted to lay down 102 yards of
tramway to his coal-works at the Moorwood, and Mr. Thomas Phillips to put
up a steam engine at the Union Colliery, in Oaken Hill Enclosure.&nbsp;
There was also another tramway extension by the Bullo Pill Company to the
Folly and Whimsey Collieries at the head of the Dam Pool.&nbsp; A junction
was effected in 1823 between the Severn and Wye, and the Bullo Pill
Tramway, by means of the Churchway Summit, parallel to Serridge, thus
connecting the eastern and western lines of traffic.</p>
<p>In the year 1822 the consecration of the third of the Forest Churches,
St. Paul&rsquo;s, for which a site had been given by the Crown on
Mason&rsquo;s Tump, at Park End, took place on the 25th of April, Bishop
Ryder attending.</p>
<p>The Fourth Triennial Report of the Commissioners of Woods, dated 1823,
intimates disappointment at the <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>little growth made by the new plantations, now
eight or nine years old; but, on the other hand, it was observed that
&ldquo;they were doing well, and that slowness of growth was inseparable
from their nature, particularly at that age.&rdquo;&nbsp; We learn from Mr.
Machen&rsquo;s Notes that at this time, and again in the two succeeding
years, very severe frosts, in one instance as late as the 23rd of June,
greatly injured the young trees, more especially such as grew in low, moist
situations, although in some degree it also touched those on higher
lands.</p>
<p>The property known as &ldquo;the Great Doward Estate&rdquo; was
purchased by the Crown, in 1824, from the Miss Griffins, for
&pound;15,000.&nbsp; Although separated by the river Wye, and situated in
Herefordshire, and never before included within the limits of the Forest,
it certainly groups with the High Meadow Woods, clothing the same valley;
and it moreover forms a definite part of the geological basin of the
district.</p>
<p>In March, 1825, the well-known and prosperous Nelson Colliery was
commenced by Messrs. Bennett and Meek.&nbsp; A branch line of tramway was
also made up to Mr. Mushet&rsquo;s Mine, near the Shute Castle Hill
Enclosure, from the Severn and Wye line at Park End.</p>
<p>In each of the seasons of 1824&ndash;25 and 1825&ndash;26, Mr. Machen
states that about 500 acres of the High Meadow property was planted with
oak, Scotch fir, and larch, in proportions varying with the nature of the
soil and openness of the situation.&nbsp; In the parts where shelter was
most requisite, two-thirds of fir and one-third of oak were planted, in
others half of each, and in sheltered situations oak alone.&nbsp; A great
many of these plants perished in the spring and summer of 1825 from heat
and drought, and still more in 1826, which was the driest spring and summer
ever remembered.&nbsp; In some high and shallow parts nearly every tree
died; a great many also were eaten off and destroyed by the hares and
rabbits.&nbsp; There were now 3,000 acres of wood on the High Meadow
estate, viz. 2,000 acres of old woods, and 1,000 acres lately
planted.&nbsp; In the year last mentioned the Fifth Triennial Report of the
Commissioners of Woods, &amp;c., <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>was issued, signed by
Charles Arbuthnot, Wm. Dacres Adams, and Henry Dawkins.</p>
<p>By the spring of 1827 Mr. Edward Protheroe effected the opening of
collieries at Ivy Moore Head, Park End Main, Park End Royal Pits, and at
Birch Well, at most of which pumping and winding engines were put up, a
tramway 1,500 yards in length connecting them with the main road of the
Severn and Wye Company.&nbsp; The same year saw a reduction of the landed
property of the Crown by the sale of its rights in the Fence Woods, Mawkins
Hazels, and Hudnalls, comprising a total of 1,273 acres 3 roods 9 poles,
for &pound;925.&nbsp; The Crown&rsquo;s right in Hudnalls, although it
contained 1,200 acres, was of little value, as the inhabitants of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s had the right of cutting wood on it.</p>
<p>Passing over the next year, the earliest circumstance in order of time
is the opening of the important colliery at Crump Meadow, and the
construction of 1,200 yards of tramway, uniting it with the main line of
the Bullo Pill Company above Cinderford, all which was executed by Mr.
Protheroe.</p>
<p>We next find, under the date of March 16th, 1829, Mr. Machen
observing&mdash;&ldquo;Although the Scotch firs have succeeded so well as
nurses for the oaks, and have brought them forward, making them healthy and
thriving on land that without shelter would only have produced them stunted
and unthrifty, yet I am inclined on the whole to prefer larch.&nbsp; They
are a shelter available for the purpose, although not so complete; but by
that means the oaks are not kept too warm and brought too forward, and the
larch is more valuable in itself.&nbsp; In some of our cold valleys,
however, the larch will not grow, the spring frosts cutting them
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also remarks&mdash;&ldquo;We are now planting the oaks
by the side of the road from &lsquo;Jack of the Yat&rsquo; to Coleford Lane
End, those at the White Oak, and opposite the Buckholt, and those leading
to Eastbatch, having been planted in 1827 and 1828.&nbsp; The space of road
left is about fifty feet.&nbsp; Most of the trees are brought from the
Vallets Enclosure, and do not <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>cost more than four pence each to replant
them.&nbsp; They are twelve to fifteen feet high, and a man can carry about
two of them at a time.&nbsp; We are also planting the Lodge Hill about York
Lodge, at the rate of 300 to an acre, leaving them without any
fence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the 6th of June this same year the sixth and last of the
&ldquo;Triennial Reports of the Commissioners of Woods,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
came out, signed Lowther, Wm. Dacres Adams, Henry Dawkins.</p>
<p>With reference to 1830, Mr. Machen&rsquo;s note-book supplies the
following memoranda:&mdash;&ldquo;2nd March, planted trees on each side the
road to Breem, also on the side of the Coleford Road below Bromley
Enclosure, and about Catchcan Coal-works, continuing the avenue down the
Long Hill, planting also the delves between Serridge and Sallow Vallets, at
a cost of about four pence per tree, no fences being put round them.&nbsp;
We planted also in the Greens of Russell&rsquo;s Enclosure.&nbsp; Some
pineasters and larch were likewise planted on the old Quarry Mounts, by the
sides of the road leading from Park End to Coleford, as likely, if
successful, to produce a good effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(March, 1831, all died; renewed March, 1834&mdash;these mostly
alive and flourishing.)&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May 28th.&mdash;The most extraordinary blight is now upon the
trees that I believe ever was known: it is confined entirely to the oak,
and chiefly to the large trees, although in some parts it is extending to
the young plantations.&nbsp; The whole of the High Meadow woods and great
part of the Forest, particularly Russell&rsquo;s Enclosure, and where the
timber is thick, are entirely stripped of their leaves, and look as if fire
had passed through them.&nbsp; Where a beech stands amongst them, it is
perfectly green, and the oaks all around quite brown.&nbsp; The grubs and
their webs are so thick, that it is disagreeable to ride amongst the trees,
and like going into a net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 8th June, 1830, the First Annual Report of the Commissioners
under the 10th Geo. IV., c. 50, was issued.&nbsp; It was signed by Lord
Lowther, Wm. Dacres <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Adams, and Henry Dawkins.&nbsp; Mr. Machen
states in his Memoranda, that &ldquo;this winter single trees were planted
on Breem Eaves; triple rows on Clearwell Meend, by the roads on Coverham,
on the Delves.&nbsp; We mended over the spots that have failed in Oaken
Hill, Stapledge, Acorn Patch, Crab-tree Hill, Sallow Vallets (chiefly by
drawing out where the trees are too thick).&nbsp; Most of the enclosures
are now quite filled up.&rdquo;&nbsp; And under date Nov. 1831, he gives
the following statement of the several plantations:&mdash;</p>

<p>The year 1831 is chiefly remarkable for the riotous destruction
committed on the fences and banks of the enclosures, recorded by Mr. Machen
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In May, 1831, several of the single trees planted
near Parkend, and on Breem&rsquo;s Eaves, were wilfully cut off in the
night, and no discovery was made of the offenders.&nbsp; In the end of May
a part of the wall of Oaken Hill Enclosure was thrown down in the
night.&nbsp; When the workmen were rebuilding it, some of the colliers
passing by threw out hints that it would not stand long, and in one or two
instances horses and cattle were turned into the enclosures, and the
woodmen were told that they had been shut up long enough, and they ought to
be thrown open.&nbsp; The gates of several plantations had been broken in
the night.&nbsp; On Sunday the 5th of June I saw Henry and Richard Dobbes
pull away the bushes out of a gateway, and turn their cow into Cockshoots
Enclosure, and when I went and expostulated with them they said they had
been deprived of their rights long enough.&nbsp; Warren James had for some
time been urging others to join him in the recovery of their rights, which
they considered to be usurped by <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>foreigners, in whose
hands the principal coal-works of the Forest are, by purchase or lease from
free miners; and on the 3rd June he had a hand-bill printed, calling upon
all persons to meet and clear the Forest on Wednesday June 8th.&nbsp; I
spoke to him on the 5th, and told him in the presence of numbers the folly
and danger of his proceedings; but he paid no attention, and said the
Forest was given up to them in Parliament the year before; that he had a
charter, which he would bring and show me.&nbsp; I published a notice,
warning all persons not to join an unlawful assembly, and on Tuesday the
7th Mr. Ducarel and I issued a warrant to apprehend him; but it could not
be executed.&nbsp; We swore in a number of special constables, and with the
woodmen mustered about forty at the scene of action where they were to
begin; but the rioters mustered nearly 200, with axes, &amp;c., and began
their work of destruction about 7 o&rsquo;clock, and we found it useless to
attempt to stop them.&nbsp; They were soon joined by others, and supplied
with cider, and continued their work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, in which time they destroyed nearly one-third of the fences in
the Forest, the reparation of which cost about &pound;1,500.&nbsp; On
Sunday military arrived, and they all dispersed.&nbsp; Warren James was
apprehended and sentenced to transportation for life, and seven or eight
others to different periods of imprisonment from one month to two years. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; Those who escaped suffered by lying in the
woods and concealed where they could, and I believe all now repent and see
the folly of their conduct.&nbsp; I suppose altogether nearly 2,000,
including children, were employed in the work of devastation.&nbsp; None of
the trees in the enclosures were injured, and where the cattle and sheep
that were let in had eaten the grass in the drives and <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>open places, they
went back into the unenclosed Forest, and would not remain amongst the
trees.&nbsp; In 1838 a pardon was sent out to Warren James, but he is not
yet come home (June, 1839), and he has not written to any one.&nbsp; (1848:
nothing heard of or from Warren James.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The above disturbance shows that an unsettled state of feeling existed
in the minds of the foresters with regard to certain supposed rights of
free-common, and which prevailed also on other points, such as the nature
and extent of the coal-gales, and the fact that the various works were fast
passing from the hands of the native free miners into those of the
foreigners; all which grievances a mischievous periodical called &lsquo;The
Forester,&rsquo; published at Newnham, set forth in an exaggerated and
exciting manner.&nbsp; Under such circumstances the Act of 1831 (1 and 2
Gul. IV., c. 12), authorizing the appointment of Commissioners to
investigate such complaints, was well timed.&nbsp; The Commissioners were
instructed to ascertain the boundaries of the Forest and the encroachments
thereon; to inquire into the rights and privileges claimed by free miners
of the hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, the constitution, powers,
jurisdiction, and practice of the court held there, as well as respecting a
court called &ldquo;the Mine Law Court,&rdquo; and to report on the
expediency of parochializing the Forest.</p>
<p>It appears from the annual Report of the Commissioners of Woods,
&amp;c., dated the 8th August, 1831, and signed by Lord Duncannon, Wm.
Dacres Adams, and Henry Dawkins, that no new works were commenced this
year, except the erection of a water-mill for grinding ochre, near Sowdley,
arising probably from the unsettled condition of the district.&nbsp; It
states, however, that the Crown had created an endowment of &pound;30 per
annum towards keeping the three existing churches of the Forest in repair,
the congregations using them being considered too poor to do so.</p>
<p>On the 21st January, 1832, the following gentlemen were appointed to act
as Commissioners of Inquiry under the late Act:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;  <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>Robert Gordon, Esq., M.P., Kemble.<br />
&nbsp;  Ebenezer Ludlow, Esq., Serjeant at Law.<br />
&nbsp;  Charles Bathurst, Esq., Lydney Park.<br />
&nbsp;  Edward Machen, Esq., Whitemead Park.<br />
&nbsp;  Henry Clifford, Esq., Over Ross, Herefordshire.<br />
&nbsp;  <i>Clerk</i>, Thomas Graham, Esq., Mitre Court, Temple.<br />
&nbsp;  <i>Surveyor</i>, Mr. John Hosmer.</p>
<p>They held most of their sittings at the Bear Inn, in Newnham, although
they also sat occasionally at Coleford, the Speech House, St.
Briavel&rsquo;s, and Westbury.&nbsp; They were thus occupied most of the
days in the months of February, March, April, and September, in hearing
evidence &ldquo;as to St. Briavel&rsquo;s Court and Prison,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;as to making the Forest parochial,&rdquo; or &ldquo;as to the rights
and privileges claimed by free miners,&rdquo; and &ldquo;as to the rights
to open or work quarries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all these sections of inquiry, the only one which the Commissioners
found they could at this time bring to a close was that having reference to
St. Briavel&rsquo;s Court, respecting which it appeared in evidence that
out of the 402 suits brought into it during the last twelve months, all but
five were for debts mostly under &pound;5, to recover which a charge of
&pound;6 or &pound;7 might be incurred.</p>
<p>The prison attached to the Court is thus described:&mdash;&ldquo;There
is only one window, which is 1 foot wide, and in a recess.&nbsp; It does
not open.&nbsp; The size of the room is 16&frac12; feet by 17&frac12; feet;
13 feet high; three corners cut off.&nbsp; In one corner is the doorway,
2&frac12; feet broad, but no door, leading into the passage about 6 feet
long, out of which the privy opens.&nbsp; There is a door at the outer end
of the passage, and in it a hole which is considered necessary for
air.&nbsp; The floor and ceiling are of wood, and in the former are several
crevices and holes.&nbsp; There is a space between the ceiling of the
parlour beneath and the floor of the prison-room above, which is so filled
with fleas and dust that in summer time it cannot be got rid of by any
cleanliness.&nbsp; The privy is a dark winding recess, about 6 feet from
front to back, taken out of the solid castle walls.&nbsp; It leads to a
hole going down to the bottom <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>of the building, which is always inaccessible
for cleaning, but which till six years ago had a drain from it into the
moat; the air draws up through it into the passage and room.&nbsp; There is
no water within the prisoners&rsquo; liberty, and they are therefore
obliged to get some person to fetch it for them.&nbsp; The Courtroom is in
a bad state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In consideration of these facts, the Commissioners in their Report upon
it, which was published 7th July, very properly declared that the said
Court was an evil, and required remodelling altogether, and they suggested
its conversion into a Court of Requests, in which the strict forms of law
might be dispensed with, parties appearing and being examined in person,
without the intervention of professional agents.&nbsp; Its Commissioners
might comprise the Constable of the Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, the
verderers of the Forest, the magistrates of the neighbourhood, and about
thirty other persons, any two of whom, under the presidency of one of the
former, should form a Court, and decide cases of debt from 10s. to
&pound;10, with power to direct payment of the debt by <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>instalments, or
levies upon goods on failure of payment, there being no imprisonment of the
person except for fraud, which should then take place in the county gaol at
Little Dean, where, or at Coleford, the Court should meet the first Monday
in every month.&nbsp; Such was the purport of the Report the Commissioners
made to Parliament on the 7th July in this year.</p>

<p>The Fourth Annual Report of the Commissioners of Woods, &amp;c., dated
the 28th of August, 1832, states that Messrs. Hill had obtained the
permission of the Crown, under a lease for thirty-one years, and a rental
of &pound;25, to remove all that they could find of the slag, cinders, and
refuse of the ancient ironworks; thus resuming an occupation which had been
discontinued for many years.&nbsp; The new Fancy Pits were now furnished
with two engines and we also find that for a time timber ceased to be
supplied from this Forest to the Royal Dockyards.</p>
<p>The Dean Forest Commissioners resumed their sittings the next year
(1833) on the 12th of April at Newnham, and proceeded to hear further
evidence &ldquo;as to the rights and privileges claimed by free
miners;&rdquo; but the only <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>important occurrence which ensued was the
presentation of a &ldquo;Memorial,&rdquo; by Mr. Mushet, on behalf of
parties not free miners, specifying the claims which such proprietors and
occupiers of coal and iron mines in the Forest had to the support of
Government in maintaining their position in the district.&nbsp; The
Memorial states that &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; had possessed coal and iron
mines time out of mind, as appeared by the case of several gentlemen and
freeholders of the parish of Newland, who, as long since as the year 1675,
claimed the right to open certain works without any objection being made by
the free miners, a liberty which, whenever it was acted upon, seems always
to have benefited the public; that none of the documents of the Mine Law
Court appear to exclude foreigners from working the mines; on the contrary,
the Resolutions of that Court, passed 1775, establish such a right,
allowing the free miner to sell or bequeath his property in the mines to
any persons he may think proper; that the old gale-books contain the names
of many persons not free miners, which, with similar testimony from Messrs.
Tovey, James, &amp;c., showed such to have been the uniform practice for
sixty years; that the foreigners have always carried on their works with
the full knowledge and authority of the Crown; that the free miners do not
possess the necessary capital for carrying on the works, in which the
foreigners have invested &pound;700,000; and, lastly, that the Crown has
gained several thousand pounds per annum in consequence.&nbsp; Twenty-one
persons signed this Memorial, as also the representatives of the Forest of
Dean and the Cinderford Iron Companies.</p>
<p>Another Memorial was likewise presented by a dozen of the inhabitants of
the Forest, showing that, instead of their cottages and gardens tending to
throw a burden on the adjoining parishes, the very contrary was the case,
as many were therefore enabled to support themselves without applying to
those parishes.&nbsp; The petitioners also prayed that no further part of
the Forest might be enclosed for the supposed benefit of the adjacent
parishes, as thereby many persons would be <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>deprived of
grazing-land for their cattle, and in consequence be necessitated to apply
to the next parishes for assistance.</p>
<p>Alluding to the state of the woods at this time (1833), Mr.
Machen&rsquo;s Notes, under the date of the 29th of May,
state:&mdash;&ldquo;This is now the fourth year in which the blight has
been so prevailing upon the oak and in the Forest.&nbsp; I think this year
it is worse than ever, and now the young plantations suffer most, the large
timber being comparatively free.&nbsp; Park Hill, Oaken Hill, Nag&rsquo;s
Head, Barn Hill, Stapledge, &amp;c., and especially all the higher parts of
them, are leafless, except where a beech or a chesnut shows its green
foliage amidst the brown oaks.&nbsp; I saw a few rooks in Russell&rsquo;s
to-day, and last year I noticed great numbers.&nbsp; They seem to be drawn
to the Forest to feed on the grubs, for they are not generally here, and I
only hope they will increase.&nbsp; The woodmen complain that in some
situations the running of the bark has been checked; but considering it has
now been four years, it seems wonderful that more injury is not done to the
trees: they put out new leaves at the midsummer shoot, and appear to
recover.&nbsp; June 4th: found the grubs changed into a chrysalis, enclosed
in a leaf, with a kind of web round it.&nbsp; June 18th: the moths appeared
in vast numbers.&nbsp; The rooks are still about in Park Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usual Report to Government, being the fifth annual one, was issued
on the 28th August, 1833, signed &ldquo;Duncannon, W. D. Adams, B. C.
Stephenson.&rdquo;&nbsp; Licence was granted to construct 600 yards of
tramway from the Severn and Wye line up to the Church Hill Colliery at Park
End, and the Dean Forest Commissioners appointed under the Act of
Parliament (1 &amp; 2 Gul. IV. c. 12) had their commission extended.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1833 the Dean Forest Commissioners directed their
attention to the important object of settling the limits of the Forest, in
doing which they wisely determined to be governed by the Messrs.
Driver&rsquo;s maps of 1787, according to which the Forest boundaries <!--
page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>had for
a length of time been regarded as practically settled, comprising the soil,
timber, and herbage actually belonging to the Crown.&nbsp; Its boundaries
as thus defined were perambulated in due ancient form, commencing on the
10th of September. <a name="citation118"></a><a href="#footnote118"
class="citation">[118]</a>&nbsp; The cavalcade included Commissioners
Robert Gordon, Esq.; Mr. Serjeant Ludlow; Charles Bathurst, Esq.; and
Edward Machen, Esq., the Deputy-Surveyor; with Mr. Graham, their Clerk; and
Mr. Hosmer, their Surveyor; followed by the keepers and woodmen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We began&rdquo; (writes Mr. Machen) &ldquo;on Tuesday at Little
Dean, and ended at Breem; Wednesday we ended at Hoarthorns, Thursday at
Drybrook, Friday at the Stenders, and Saturday at Little Dean.&nbsp; We
were occupied eight or nine hours each day, accomplishing about nine miles
daily by the map, but the actual distance must have been nearly
double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The year 1834 is marked by the Dean Forest Commissioners issuing their
second Report, dated 1st of May, in which, after briefly explaining the
data on which the late perambulation had been conducted, they proceed to
state that, as respects the various encroachments, 1,510 acres 2 roods 32
poles were taken in before 1787.&nbsp; Since that date, and up to the year
1812, further encroachments to the extent of 573 acres 10&frac12; poles had
been made, and again from 1812 to the present time 24 acres 2 roods
9&frac12; poles had been taken in.&nbsp; In consideration of the Crown
never having reclaimed the old encroachments, the Commissioners recommended
that all such lands &ldquo;should be declared to be freehold of
inheritance,&rdquo; provided no additional dwelling-houses were erected on
them without the licence of the Crown.&nbsp; They advised that the next
oldest encroachments &ldquo;should be granted to their present possessors
for three lives, not renewable except at the pleasure of the Crown, and
paying rents varying from one shilling to two shillings per
acre.&rdquo;&nbsp; As to the latest encroachments, they gave their opinion
that &ldquo;their possessors should have terms varying from fourteen to
twenty-one years, paying rents <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>varying from four to eight shillings per acre;
the condition as to building dwelling-houses to apply to these classes
also.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following table, showing the acreage of the
encroachments, classed as stated above, with the number of houses situate
in the six &ldquo;Walks&rdquo; of the Forest, serves to exhibit the
localities of the population of the district for the last hundred
years.</p>

<p>During the greater part of September this year the Dean Forest
Commissioners were engaged either at Newnham, Westbury, or the Speech-house
hearing evidence &ldquo;as to forming the Forest into a Parish,&rdquo; and
respecting &ldquo;Rights of Common.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the design of
eliciting the opinions of the neighbourhood on the first head, for civil
purposes only, &ldquo;a circular was drawn up on the subject of enclosing
lands on the outward boundaries of the Forest, with a view of relieving the
conterminous parishes from the support of the Forest poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was sent to the parishes bordering on the Forest, requesting the attendance
of the clergymen, overseers, and landowners, for the purpose of discussing
such a plan.&nbsp; This courteous invitation was responded to by the parish
authorities of Westbury, Flaxley, Little Dean, Mitcheldean, Awre, Staunton,
Ruerdean, the Lea hamlet, Bicknor, and St. Briavel&rsquo;s, the Rev. H.
Berkin attending on the part of the Forest clergy, when the scheme of the
Commissioners was unanimously approved.&nbsp; By the evidence taken under
the second head, <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>it appears that the parishes or tithings of
Westbury, Little Dean, Awre, Ruerdean, Bicknor, Lea hamlet, Breem,
Clearwell, Newland, Lydney, St. Briavel&rsquo;s, Newnham, Woolaston, and
Purton, claimed the right of Common of Pasture.</p>
<p>In the same month &ldquo;the Free Miners of the Forest&rdquo; presented
to the Commissioners an able memorial of their rights, in reply to that
preferred the year before by persons not free miners, but who were
proprietors and occupiers of coal and iron mines in the Forest; its object
being to prove that &ldquo;foreigners possessing and working mines therein
was in direct violation of the rights and privileges of the free miners,
contrary to their customs and franchises, and are acts of injustice and
usurpation.&rdquo;&nbsp; They affirmed that the present usage of foreigners
possessing mines was not of long standing,&mdash;that it dated from the
discontinuance of the Mine Law Court in 1777, by which all such intrusions
were strictly checked and prevented; that this Court had been in full
operation upwards of 500 years, as they verily believed, and so continued
until the last 60 years, meeting periodically under the presidency of the
Constable appointed by the King, and attended by his deputies and by the
King&rsquo;s Gaveller; and that, if this Court were re-established, and
their rights and privileges restored to them, there would be no difficulty
in finding capital for the proper working of the mines.&nbsp; The memorial
was signed by 1,036 persons, professedly free miners.&nbsp; But, as to this
being the fact, a further memorial was presented to the Commissioners on
the 23rd of December, urging &ldquo;that no person should be considered a
free miner whose birth from parents free miners cannot be proved, in
addition to their having been born in the Forest, and worked in the mines a
year and a day.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to such rule, the original number of
1,036 would be reduced to 798.&nbsp; On the 24th of December this year
(1834) another memorial, coming from free miners in the occupation of
stone-quarries within the Forest, was laid before the Commissioners,
pleading in few words for similar rights <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>and customs in
respect of stone-quarries as were claimed in regard of mines.&nbsp; The
names of thirteen quarrymen were attached thereto.</p>
<p>Upon the 9th and three following days of June in the ensuing year (1835)
the Dean Forest Commissioners, at meetings held in London, received letters
from the Bishop of the diocese, from the clergymen of the Forest, and of
the Lea and Flaxley parishes, recommending the parochializing the Forest
for ecclesiastical purposes, either by means of curates with small chapels,
or by dividing the whole into a certain number of distinct districts
severally provided with a church and an incumbent.&nbsp; The Commissioners
reported unanimously in favour of making the Forest parochial; and for all
spiritual purposes they recommended an assignment of districts to each of
the churches already built, as also the erection of a church and parsonage
at Cinderford, with a stipend of &pound;150 annexed, to which amount the
salaries of the three existing ministers should also be raised.&nbsp; They
further recommended the enlargement of the Lydbrook school-room into a
chapel, with &pound;80 stipend to the clergyman serving it; and they
likewise advised forming Viney Hill, having a population of nearly 800,
into a district, or annexing it to Blakeney, the church there, and
minister&rsquo;s salary, being enlarged accordingly.&nbsp; They also
suggested that the 150 persons residing on Pope&rsquo;s Hill should be
united to Flaxley, with &pound;20 added to the clergyman&rsquo;s stipend;
and that the Lea Bailey, with its 100 inhabitants, should be annexed in the
same manner, and under the same conditions, to the Lea parish.</p>
<p>In the second place, as to the relief of the poor inhabitants of the
Forest, the Commissioners were of opinion that it would be impossible to
raise a fund for this purpose by means of rates on property, as so much was
in the actual occupation of the Crown, or connected with mining, or the
holders being too poor to bear the burthen.&nbsp; They advised, therefore,
that about 1,600 acres of the Forest land should be enclosed and let out
for the purpose of furnishing such a provision, to be <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>dispensed at the
discretion of a Board composed of the constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s
Castle, the verderers, clergymen, and deputy-surveyor, and the magistrates
acting for the Forest division, and six inhabitants as coadjutors. <a
name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122"
class="citation">[122]</a></p>
<p>On the 25th of August the Dean Forest Commissioners presented their
fourth and fifth Reports.&nbsp; In the former, which gives a minute summary
of the rights and privileges claimed by the free miners (derived chiefly
from the evidence taken in 1832), the origin of them is stated to be
involved in obscurity, although no doubt iron was manufactured in the
neighbourhood as early as the time of the Romans, and coal was obtained in
the reign of Edward III.&nbsp; Probably before, and certainly soon after,
the Norman Conquest, the soil was vested in the Crown, and all the rights
of a royal forest were in force.&nbsp; The persons by whom the mines were
then worked could not have been, in the first instance, free tenants of the
Crown.&nbsp; It is more likely that they were in a state of servitude, and
subject, in that character, to perform the labour required of them.&nbsp;
The name of &ldquo;Free Miners,&rdquo; by which they are and have been for
centuries known, seems to refer to some right or privilege distinct from
their original condition; and it does not appear unreasonable to suppose
that certain persons at some distant period, either by having worked for a
year and a day, or by reason of some now unknown circumstance connected
with the origin of the privilege, were considered as emancipated, and
thereupon became entitled or were allowed to work the mines upon their own
adventure, concurrently with or subject to the right of the Crown to a
certain portion of the product.</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>Noticing in succession many of the historical incidents attaching
to the free miners of the Forest, the Report states that the franchise of
the mine was unquestionably perpetuated by birth from a free father in the
hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, and afterwards working a year and a day in
one of the mines and abiding within the hundred.&nbsp; Doubt is, however,
thrown upon the necessity of birth from a free miner, the more so as the
son of a foreigner could obtain his freedom after working out an
apprenticeship of seven years with a free miner; and it would be difficult,
if not impossible, at the present time, to confine the title to anything
beyond birth and service, to which particular class of individuals the
Court of Mine Law confined all mining operations.</p>
<p>Entering in the next place into a consideration of the actual claims of
the free miners, the Commissioners declare their opinion as to how their
claims are to be settled, suggesting at once the question &ldquo;whether
they can be now maintained with advantage to the miners themselves, or to
the community,&rdquo; connected as they are with a most defective system of
working, productive of incessant disputes and expensive litigation, and
occasioning constant disputes and never-ending jealousy; and they thus
conclude&mdash;&ldquo;Taking all the circumstances of the case into
consideration, we are of opinion that the monopoly and customary workings
are practically at an end, and that, if individual claims were bought up,
the whole coal-field might then be let by the Crown as between landlord and
tenant, defining the limits and regulating the working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fifth and final Report of the Dean Forest Commissioners bore the
same date as the preceding.&nbsp; It contains the evidence produced before
them as to &ldquo;certain claims of common of pasture&rdquo; made by the
inhabitants of the following parishes bounding the Forest, and paying a
small sum annually, called &ldquo;herbage money,&rdquo; to the lessee of
the Crown of the manor and hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, and the manor of
Newland, as annexed:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is highly probable that the above claims, and the payments for the
ancient agistments, originated when the limits of the Forest comprehended
the parishes by which they are made.&nbsp; The earliest authentic trace of
them occurs in the agreement made by Charles I. with Sir John Winter in
1640, according to which about 4,000 acres of Crown land was to be taken in
and attached to the bordering parishes in lieu of their rights of
commonage; and in conformity with the principle of this agreement, the
Commissioners recommended &ldquo;that these commonable rights should be
comprised in some general arrangement for the purpose of a
commutation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last subject the Commissioners notice is the stone-quarries, which
persons born within the hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s claimed the right of
opening in the waste lands of the Forest, on payment of a fee of three
shillings to the gaveller, and an annual rent of three shillings and
fourpence, according to the custom of at least the last hundred years, a
period too long to justify the withdrawal of any existing gale, unless by
compensation.&nbsp; Hence all that the Commissioners found themselves <!--
page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>justified in recommending to the Crown, with the view of putting
the working of the stone-quarries on a better footing, was to re-issue
gales on liberal leases to all parties born within the hundred who applied
for the same within a specified time.</p>
<p>In bringing their labours to a close, the Commissioners urge the
necessity of passing an Act for definitively settling the several
particulars to which their inquiries had been directed, adding that it
would be well to incorporate the offices of Constable of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, and Warden of the Forest, with the office of Woods,
lest they should be found to interfere with its future administration, at
that time under the charge of Lord Duncannon, B. C. Stephenson, Esq., and
A. Milne, Esq.; and this was accordingly done in the following year.</p>
<p>We gather from Mr. Machen&rsquo;s memoranda that the nurseries in the
Forest at this time (1835) contained:&mdash;</p>

<p>and, moreover, that 276,054 trees of various kinds had been planted out
during the previous winter.</p>
<p>On the 27th of July, 1838, the Royal Assent was given to &ldquo;an Act
for regulating the opening and working of mines and quarries in the Forest
of Dean, and Hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, by the agency of a Board of
Commissioners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thomas Sopwith, Esq., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
was appointed by the Board of Woods and Forests a Commissioner for the
purpose on behalf of the Crown; and John Probyn, Esq., of Longhope
Manor-house, Gloucestershire, was selected by the body of free miners to
act on their behalf; and the office of arbitrator between them was filled
by John Buddle, Esq., of Wallsend, in the county of Northumberland; Thomas
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>Graham, Esq., acting as their solicitor, and Mr. Henry Ebsworth
as his clerk. <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a></p>
<p>Some idea may be formed of the necessity for such a mining Commission,
and of the difficulties it had to overcome, from the following particulars,
as Mr. Sopwith stated them in his valuable Paper on &ldquo;Mining Plans and
Records,&rdquo; read before the British Association at Newcastle in
1838:&mdash;&ldquo;Great distrust of any interference&rdquo; (he says)
&ldquo;existed, and some of the mine-owners refused to allow of underground
surveys being made.&nbsp; Numerous and conflicting parties were then
working mines under customs which were totally inapplicable to the present
state of mining; destructive at once to the interests of the free miners of
the Forest; ruinous, as sad experience had shown, to the enterprising
capitalist; and subversive of the rights of the Crown.&nbsp; So great was
the perplexity, and so numerous and conflicting were the claims of
contending parties, that the law advisers of the Board of Woods deemed it
almost impossible to arrive at any satisfactory adjustment of them within
the period of three years, as named in the Dean Forest Mining Act.&nbsp;
The ruinous and unsatisfactory state of the mines must appear obvious on a
slight consideration.&nbsp; As no plans existed, it was impossible to tell
to what extent or in what direction the underground works were being
carried.&nbsp; The crossing of mattocks, that is to say, the actual meeting
of the workmen underground, was often the abrupt signal for contention; the
driving of narrow headings was a means by which one coal-owner might gain
possession of coal which of right belonged to another; and a pit, though
sunk at a cost of several thousand pounds, had no secured possession of
coal beyond 12 yards round it, that is, a tract of coal 24 yards in
diameter.&nbsp; At 40 or 50 yards from such a work another adventurer might
commence a pit, and have an equal right, if right it could <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>be called,
to the coal.&nbsp; If a long and expensive adit was driven, another one
might be commenced only a few yards deeper; and, from such a state of
things, it is quite clear that great uncertainty and frequent losses
inevitably ensued.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, the receipts from mines and
minerals, by the Crown, upon the average of the six preceding years, were
only &pound;826 2s. 10&frac12;d.</p>
<p>The important Act by which these difficulties were to be removed, under
the auspices of the three Commissioners above named, was framed in
accordance with the suggestion thrown out in the fourth Report of the Dean
Forest Commissioners, viz., that all subsisting mine-works should be
released by compensation to the Crown, and the whole relet on a
well-defined plan to such free miners as might make application for the
same.&nbsp; The Act (1 and 2 Vict. cap. 43) provides that all male persons
born and abiding within the hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, being upwards
of twenty-one years of age and having worked a year and a day in a coal or
iron mine or stone-quarry within the said hundred, should alone have the
right to hold or dispose of such works, a register of all such persons
being kept as &ldquo;free miners.&rdquo;&nbsp; It suppressed all claims to
pit timber, with all &ldquo;customs,&rdquo; and assigned to the
Commissioners under the Act the duty of fixing rents and royalties for
twenty-one years, and to the gaveller power to limit and regulate as well
as to enter and survey all works which might be re-awarded or galed.&nbsp;
No engines were to be erected nearer than sixty yards to any enclosure,
within which only air-shafts might be opened, and all unnecessary buildings
were to be removed.</p>
<p>On the 16th of August, 1838, the annual Report of the Commissioners of
Woods was issued, signed by Lord Duncannon, B. C. Stephenson and A. Milne,
Esqrs.&nbsp; It mentions that a piece of land in the parish of English
Bicknor had been granted for school purposes, and that the Severn and Wye
Tramway Company obtained the licence of the Crown to lay down a branch from
Brook Hall Ditches to Foxes Bridge.</p>
<p>The only circumstance requiring notice in the following <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>year is the
decease of the second Commissioner of Woods, Sir B. C. Stephenson, who had
long held the office, and he was succeeded by the Honourable Charles
Gore.</p>
<p>The next annual Report bears date 29th July, 1840, and contains nothing
calling for special notice.</p>
<p>The year 1841 is particularly important in the history of the Forest
from its being the date of the present coal and iron mine awards, under the
authority of the Mining Commissioners, the former being signed on the 8th
of March, and the latter on the 20th of July.&nbsp; By these awards no less
than 104 collieries were defined and assigned, together with twenty
iron-mines, and certain rules and regulations were laid down for working
them.</p>
<p>The duties of the Mining Commissioners having now closed, it must have
been highly gratifying to those gentlemen to receive from the Government
the following expressions of commendation, communicated by Mr. A.
Milne:&mdash;&ldquo;I am to convey to you our entire approbation of the
zeal, ability, and sound discretion which appear to have marked all your
proceedings in the performance of the very important, difficult, and
laborious duties which devolved upon you, and their belief that, while the
result will be very beneficial to the interests of the Crown, it will be
attended with equal advantage to the great body of mining adventurers in
securing their titles to the property on very reasonable and moderate
terms, and subject to the regulations and conditions which seem to be well
calculated to protect them from that constant and expensive litigation
which had so long existed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The total cost of adjusting the working of the coal and iron mines was
&pound;10,459 1s. 3d.&nbsp; The valuable services of the Mining
Commissioners were again noticed in the annual Report of the Board of
Woods, published on the 9th August in the following year, when 408 acres 2
roods were thrown open in Blakeney Hill (south) and the South Lea Bailey
Copse, a similar extent of open Forest being enclosed at St. Low and Great
Kenseley.&nbsp; It also adverts to an Act passed on 30th of July previous,
dividing the Forest into ecclesiastical <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>districts,
constituting them &ldquo;Perpetual Curacies,&rdquo; and attaching the
churches of Christ Church, Holy Trinity, and St. Paul&rsquo;s to them, the
stipends of each being raised to &pound;150.&nbsp; The patronage of the two
former was vested in the Crown, and the latter in the Bishop of the
Diocese.&nbsp; The Act likewise authorizes the formation of a fourth
district at Cinderford, and the erection and endowment of a church there:
thus each district comprised the following number of acres:&mdash;</p>

<p>The same Report also notices the provisions now made for the relief of
the poor, and for the abolition of the court and prison of the hundred of
St. Briavel&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Act for the relief of the poor is dated the
9th of July, and authorizes the introduction of the new Poor Law, dividing
the Forest into the two townships of East and West Dean, by a line drawn in
a diagonal direction from Lydbrook to Ayleford, being in fact almost the
same boundary which separated the ancient divisions of &ldquo;above and
beneath the wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Act attached East Dean to the
Westbury-upon-Severn Union, and West Dean to that of Monmouth.&nbsp; It
also united the Hudnalls, the Bearse, the Fence, and Mawkins Hazells to the
parishes of St. Briavel&rsquo;s and Hewelsfield, Mailscot and an adjoining
tract to English Bicknor, and Walmore and Northwood&rsquo;s Green to the
parish of Westbury-upon-Severn, for the support of their own poor, by means
of rates levied as their respective overseers for the relief of the poor
should direct.</p>

Committee&mdash;Report of Mr. Brown&mdash;Messrs. Matthews&rsquo;s
Report.</p>
<p>By this time (1842) some of the enclosures made in 1814 were become fit
for being thrown open, the young trees having grown up sufficiently, and
the following Commissioners, viz., Lord Lincoln, A. Milne, C. Gore, Sir T.
Crawley, J. Pyrke, M. Colchester, C. Bathurst, E. Machen, P. J. Ducarel, J.
F. Brickdale, Esqrs., proceeded to authorize the laying open of 163 acres 2
roods 24 poles in Little Stapledge and Birchwood, directing that an equal
quantity of land should be added to the Acorn Patch and the Bourts.</p>
<p>In the year 1843 Beechenhurst and Shutcastle Enclosures, comprising 467
acres 2 roods 31 poles, were disenclosed, an equal extent of land at the
Delves, Harry Hill, Hangerberry, Old Croft, the Blind Meand, Cleverend
Green, Clearwell Meand, and Birch Hill being taken in.&nbsp; Upon the 22nd
of this October a sale was effected to the Crown, for the sum of
&pound;1,260, of the eligible school premises at Cinderford, erected
originally by Mr. Protheroe for his workpeople.&nbsp; On the 22nd of
October in the ensuing year, 1844, the church adjoining the school just
named, to the erection of which Dr. Warneford and Charles Bathurst, Esq.,
largely contributed, was consecrated by Bishop Monk, the Crown endowing it
with &pound;150 per annum, making the total sum given by the Government to
church endowments in the Forest upwards of &pound;10,347.&nbsp; The
following year is almost a blank in the annals of the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
The Report of the Commissioners of Woods was issued on the 5th of
August.</p>
<p><!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>In 1846 enclosures to the extent of 1,433 acres 3 roods 5 poles,
comprising Blakeney Hill, Crab-tree Hill (North), Holly Hill, Bromley, part
of Edgehills, and part of Stapledge, were thrown open, and instead thereof
enclosures were made at Light Moor, Middle Ridge, and Phelp&rsquo;s Meadow,
Blaize Bailey, Mitcheldean Meand (North, South), and Loquiers, the Delves
No. 4, Crump Meadow, Bourts No. 1 and 2, Eastbatch Meand, and Coverham
(North and South).&nbsp; The Commissioners of Woods published their yearly
Report on the 25th of August this year, signed by Lord Morpeth.&nbsp; It
states that since 1841 upwards of 291 pieces of encroached land had been
purchased by the foresters for &pound;201 13s. 3d., and that no less than
193 grants of coal and iron mine had been galed under 1 and 2 Vict. c. 48,
at a total annual rent to the Crown of &pound;3,783, in sums varying from
&pound;1 to &pound;250, as at the Bilson Colliery, besides 315 grants of
stone-quarries at a total rent of &pound;87 9s. 7d.&nbsp; This includes the
following coal-works lately galed, viz., the collieries of Nash&rsquo;s
Folly, New Mill Engine, Unity Colliery, Nag&rsquo;s Head, Smart&rsquo;s
Delph, Gosly Knoll, producing a rental of &pound;16, and the iron-mines at
Old Park, Scarpit, Easter, Slope Pit, Yew-tree, Bromley Hill, Drybrook,
Prince of Wales, Belt, and Wigpool, bringing &pound;81 10s. to the Crown,
to all which receipts a royalty of so much per ton on the mineral sold was
added.</p>
<p>Mr. Machen&rsquo;s Notes inform us that in the autumn of 1846
&ldquo;there was the most abundant crop of Spanish chesnuts we have ever
had, and they ripen well, but the people injure the trees to get
them.&nbsp; No acorns at all&mdash;there are some on the Turkey oaks.&nbsp;
The fruit of most kinds has failed this year, as well as the potatoes; but
of some kinds, such as chesnuts, grapes, blackberries, the crop is
abundant.&nbsp; The spruce firs are looking very bad; many of them are
nearly dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except as respects the granting of additional coal and iron gales, the
succeeding year of 1847 may be passed over.&nbsp; It appears by the annual
Report which came out on the 29th of June, that the new iron-mines galed
were those of Wigpool, Dean&rsquo;s Meand, Fairplay, Lydbrook, <!-- page
132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>Symmond&rsquo;s Rock, Earl Fitzharding&rsquo;s Frog Pit,
Penswell&rsquo;s, Eastbatch, and Tufton, paying a rental to the Crown of
&pound;104, and Morgan&rsquo;s Folly Colliery, rented at &pound;4.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the year 1848, the Report of the Commissioners of Woods,
which appeared in September, informs us that upwards of 18,000 acres in the
district of the Forest were covered with wood and timber.&nbsp;
Unfortunately blight again prevailed, of which in the month of June Mr.
Machen&rsquo;s MS. records:&mdash;&ldquo;The oak-trees have been attacked
for several years past by a small caterpillar which eats all the leaves,
and this year the destruction has been greater than ever; the whole Forest
has been almost leafless; the high ground and the low, the large timber and
the young plantations, have all suffered alike.&nbsp; The first time I
noticed this blight was in 1830, when the High Meadow woods and many parts
of the Forest suffered, but it was principally confined to the large
timber.&nbsp; It has continued more or less every year since, but this has
been the worst year of any; yet it is remarkable that the High Meadow Woods
are free from it and in fine foliage, but no part of the Forest has
escaped.&nbsp; The grub, a little black caterpillar, comes to life just as
the oak is coming into leaf, and feeds upon the leaves.&nbsp; It attacks no
other tree; the beech, chesnut, &amp;c., stand in full verdure surrounded
by the brown and leafless oaks.&nbsp; They envelop the tree in a web they
spin about the end of May; they enclose themselves in a leaf curled up, and
remain in a chrysalis state until the middle of June or July, when they
change into a pale greenish small moth that flies about the trees in
myriads, and lay their eggs in the bark of the trees for future mischief,
and then die.&nbsp; There seems to be no means of checking their
ravages.&nbsp; The rooks come in great numbers, and they and other birds
destroy great quantities.&nbsp; The trees put forth a second foliage at the
midsummer shoot, but not full, and the shoot of the year and the growth of
the trees must be injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the date of the 30th of April, 1849, Messrs. John Clutton and
Richard Hall report to the <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Government, on the Forest of Dean, that
&ldquo;there are about five hundred acres of the open Forest now covered
with old timber, which is for the most part very fine and of very large
size, and is nearly all of good quality.&nbsp; Our opinion is that a large
portion of this timber is fit for naval purposes, and we suppose it to be
worth &pound;49,000.&nbsp; Its precise age we are not enabled to discover,
but our impression is that this timber is about 160 years of age.&nbsp; It
has clearly been planted since 1667, as it is recorded that only 200 trees
remained on the Forest in that time.&nbsp; There is some old timber fit for
the navy in the enclosed plantations, of the probable value of
&pound;34,500.&nbsp; There are also about 500 acres of land planted in the
Forest with single trees, which are in process of becoming fit for naval
purposes; and there is a further portion occupied with trees of spontaneous
growth.&nbsp; These, with the plantations thrown open, we estimate at 3,000
acres; the value of these we estimate at &pound;106,000.&nbsp; The Crown
has now occupied with young and old timber about 14,000 acres of the
Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same reporters speak of &ldquo;the existing plantations being in a
very good state, having been judiciously and well planted, fully stocked,
well managed, and sufficiently protected.&nbsp; They are properly drained
and amply thinned; so that there is upon the ground, in a state to proceed
to maturity, as good a crop as can be found to exist in any part of
England, taking extent and quality of soil into consideration.&nbsp; The
plantations reflect great credit upon all parties concerned in their
management, the system of which we should strongly advise to be
continued.&nbsp; To remove the young trees with the view of converting the
land into arable cultivation would involve a loss of &pound;280,500,
besides that of the increasing net annual profit, which official returns
prove to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

134</span>Early in this year a select Committee of the House of Commons was
appointed to inquire into the expenditure and management of the Woods,
Forests, and Land Revenues of the Crown, Viscount Duncan being in the
chair.&nbsp; Mr. Machen was examined by the committee with regard to the
Forest of Dean, and amongst other particulars stated that &ldquo;the fact
of the expenditure on account of this Forest having increased within the
last six years was explained by the circumstance that &pound;3,000 a year
had been laid out on the new plantations, and that the balance in favour of
the Crown had been still further reduced by the recent fall in the price of
bark and also of timber, owing probably to peculiar difficulties attending
its removal.&rdquo;&nbsp; He observed that large immediate profits could
not be obtained from the oak plantations, which would, however, increase in
value at the rate of about &pound;15,000 a year; and moreover that a
considerable revenue from the sale of timber-props for the mine-works,
&amp;c., might be expected.&nbsp; Mr. Machen also reported an improvement
in the order and conduct of the inhabitants of the Forest generally, the
fruit, it may reasonably be assumed, of the many years of pious labour
which the clergy and Christian teachers of the neighbourhood had bestowed
on the people.&nbsp; The Act of 1841, under which the mines of the Forest
were awarded, had, he said, been found most useful.&nbsp; Before the
arrangements under this Act were effected, much quarrelling and litigation
were continually taking place.&nbsp; The royalty paid by the various mines
to the Crown amounted to &pound;4,000 a year, and was steadily increasing;
eight years ago it was only &pound;700.</p>
<p>The evidence of Mr. Langham, the Assistant Deputy Surveyor, relates to
the mode in which pit-timber and cordwood for the charcoal burner were
supplied, as well as the method pursued in planting, being that of about
1,300 young oaks to the acre, and the same of larch, four feet apart.&nbsp;
Mr. Nicholson, a tenant of the Park End Colliery, forcibly urged the
construction of branch lines of railway, connecting the different works in
the Forest <!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>with the leading lines, to the certain benefit of the
coal-master, the consumer, and the Crown, the existing tramways being
inadequate to their purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Isaiah Teague took the same view, and further supported the
recommendation that greater facilities should be given, not only to the
mineowners to build cottages for their men, but also that the operatives
themselves should be enabled to buy small plots of land for the purpose,
they being now frequently obliged to live far distant from their places of
work, there being few, if any, houses situated near them.&nbsp; These
witnesses, as well as several others, agreed in stating that it was
inexpedient to have deer in the Forest, as unsettling the habits of the
people, and encouraging poaching.&nbsp; They yet admitted, however, that
the deer were highly ornamental.</p>
<p>It was also stated in evidence that the Forest was now fully planted;
and whereas some of the witnesses recommended that the larger portion of
the wood should be cut, and the remainder converted into arable or pasture
land, it was shown by others that to do so would be like cutting a crop of
wheat whilst green, and be defeating the original intention of the
Government, which was to raise timber for the use of the navy, which the
private woods of the kingdom could not supply.&nbsp; Much, too, of the soil
was said to be unsuited for farming purposes, being so precipitous in some
parts, and stony in others, as to be unfit for ploughing.&nbsp; Much of the
timber was reported to be of the finest character, and the young trees, for
the most part, doing very well.&nbsp; No improvements in the management of
the estate were suggested, and at the close of the inquiry the committee
reported that the plantations were growing luxuriantly, having been well
thinned, and did credit to all concerned in their management.</p>
<p>The succeeding year of 1850 is chiefly noticeable for a general meeting
on behalf of the fund for defraying the expenses of the contemplated
Industrial Exhibition of all Nations, to take place the next year.&nbsp; It
was held upon Wednesday the 12th of June, on the green in <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>front of the
Speech-house, under the presidency of Mr. Machen, supported by the
magistrates and master-miners of the district.&nbsp; The day was fine, and
at least 5,000 people attended&mdash;three bands of music accompanying them
from the different sides of the Forest.&nbsp; A large waggon constituted
the platform on which the speakers stood.&nbsp; The sight was a striking
one, amidst the fine foliage of the surrounding Forest, and all passed off
in a manner worthy of the occasion.</p>
<p>The Commissioners of Woods&rsquo; Report, dated the 27th of June this
year, informs us that gales of coal had been granted, under the names of
the Beaufort Engine, Oaken Hill, New Bridge, East Slade (lapsed), and the
Injunction Iron Mine&mdash;paying a total rental of &pound;54.&nbsp; In
November following this Forest contributed its quota of navy-timber,
amounting to 388 loads 22 feet, towards the total of 1,000 loads levied
upon the Royal Forests; which quantity was delivered at the Pembroke
Dockyard at the cost of &pound;992. 8s. for carriage.&nbsp; It may also be
mentioned that at the Gloucester Summer Assizes of this year the action of
Lord Seymour, as Chief Commissioner of Woods, <i>versus</i> Morrell, for
arrears of dead rent which accumulated to the amount of &pound;1,291 1s.
2d., was tried before Lord Chief Justice Campbell and a special jury, when
a verdict was found for the Crown, subject to the opinion of the Court of
Queen&rsquo;s Bench upon a special case, which proved, however,
confirmatory of the original decision.</p>
<p>On the 30th of July, 1851, the official Report on the Forest was
issued.&nbsp; It gives us the dates of three grants of land made this
spring for school purposes, situated at Viney and Blakeney Hill, and at
Ruerdean Woodside.&nbsp; It also bears fresh testimony to the satisfactory
working of the Act of 1 &amp; 2 Vict., c. 43, for regulating the opening
and working of mines and quarries, the litigation to which they had
formerly given rise under the ill-defined and objectionable customs which
had so long prevailed having almost entirely ceased.&nbsp; The actual
amount annually paid to the Crown during the last six years was stated to
be &pound;4,281 17s. 4d., besides the profit <!-- page 137--><a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>made by the sale of
pit-timber.&nbsp; Royalties and tonnage-dues were its chief sources,
although arrears of minimum or dead rent had accumulated to the extent of
&pound;12,805 8s. 2&frac12;d.&mdash;payment having been refused in some
cases on the plea that at certain times no minerals had been raised.&nbsp;
Gales of coal had been granted to Cousin&rsquo;s Engine, Beaufort, and Fox
Hole; and during the previous year 335,687 tons of coal and 80,531 tons of
iron mine had been raised.&nbsp; This autumn arrangements were made for
felling 553 loads of timber in the Forest, and 177 loads in the High Meadow
Woods, for the use of the navy, under the Queen&rsquo;s sign-manual of the
7th of May.</p>
<p>In the following year (1852) there were two grants of land for
educational and ecclesiastical purposes; one piece was for the site of a
school at the Hawthorns, and the other for a parsonage attached to the new
church at Lydbrook, which was consecrated on the previous 4th of December
by Dr. Ollivant, Lord Bishop of Llandaff, acting for Dr. Monk, who was
unable to attend.</p>
<p>During the months of April and June of this year the Right Hon. T. F.
Kennedy, who, in October, 1851, had been appointed Chief Commissioner,
visited the Forest of Dean, and was much struck with its fine character and
great capabilities.&nbsp; Impressed with the conviction that it might be
brought to yield a larger return to the Crown, he sought the advice of Mr.
Brown, well known in Scotland as a surveyor of woods, who inspected the
several plantations, and suggested that every encouragement should be given
to the extension of railways through the Forest, and also recommended the
erection of circular sawing power, for the purpose of reducing the timber
to a portable size and shape for naval purposes, by which its value would
be much increased, and the expense of carriage reduced.&nbsp; He likewise
advised that the plan hitherto pursued of stripping the bark from the young
oaks, standing, should be discontinued, and that the bark should be removed
after the trees were felled, as being more convenient, and favourable to
the durability of the wood, and likewise <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>as affording the
earliest opportunity to the adjoining trees to shoot out into the vacant
spaces.&nbsp; He also thought that the bark was better cured on stages
raising it above the ground, than merely by setting it upon an end; and he
suggested more frequent and moderate thinnings of the plantations, which
for the sake of uniformity should be marked by the same person, thinning
more on the productive soils than elsewhere.&nbsp; Mr. Brown considered,
moreover, that fewer woodmen and keepers might suffice.</p>
<p>Accordingly the bark was this autumn dried on stages, and the number of
keepers was reduced to three.&nbsp; The whole of the timber in
Russell&rsquo;s Enclosure was felled, and the trees at Howler&rsquo;s
Slade, Church Hill, Park End, and on the side of the road to Blakeney were
marked for being so, with the exception of any very large or picturesque
ones.&nbsp; At this time also the Lydbrook Deep Level Colliery, and the
East Dean Deep Colliery, were awarded; and at the close of the year Mr.
Machen resigned his office of Deputy-Gaveller, which was next held by Mr.
Warington Smith.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1853 all the timber on Church Hill, at Howler&rsquo;s
Slade, and between the Blakeney Roads was cut down, forming what is now
usually called &ldquo;the great fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mode of management
in the Forest was now rapidly changing, and Mr. Machen, the
Deputy-Surveyor, decided this year to resign, after a service of well nigh
half a century.&nbsp; He was succeeded by Mr. Brown.&nbsp; The flittern
bark of this season was dried on stages, having been taken off the young
oaks after they had been felled; but the process was not found to
answer.</p>
<p>The Hagloe estate, situated between the Forest and the river Severn, was
this year purchased by Government on account of its securing the best site
for railway communication with the South Wales line, as well as for
shipping timber, the river in that part being particularly favourable for
the purpose.&nbsp; The formation of three distinct tramways was now also
licensed, one from near Milkwall down to the Severn and Wye line, <!-- page
139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>another from
Speculation Colliery to the same point, and a third from the Ruerdean
Woodside Colliery to East Slade.</p>
<p>In the next year (1854) a select Committee of the House of Commons sat
during the month of June, under the presidency of Mr. Henry Drummond, to
collect information respecting &ldquo;the management and condition of the
Crown Forests.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far as related to the Forest of Dean, the
inquiry seems to have arisen from its being supposed that the timber
therein, of which 7,800 loads had been felled during the two previous
years, might have been sold at higher prices, and that the mode of
stripping and drying the bark was defective.&nbsp; Yet it appeared in
evidence that the price of the timber was about the same as such timber
usually fetched in the neighbourhood, and that, upon the whole, the method
of removing the bark from the trees whilst standing, and then setting it
upright to dry, was as good as that of first felling the tree, and then
stripping it and drying the bark on stages.&nbsp; Moreover, the portable
steam saw, which had been sent to the Forest with the design of cutting the
timber, as recommended by Mr. Brown, was found to be too small for the
purpose, although it was as large as could be conveniently moved from place
to place, and hence it proved of little or no use.</p>
<p>The Lords of the Treasury, desirous to satisfy the public and the
legislature as to the state of Dean Forest in common with the other Crown
Forests, directed Messrs. J. Matthews, William Murton, and W. Menzies to
make a personal examination of them, and to report their opinion
thereon.&nbsp; This they accordingly did in considerable detail.&nbsp; With
regard to Dean Forest they say&mdash;&ldquo;The enclosures were originally
planted with extreme care, their situations judiciously chosen, the land
well prepared, and the plants protected with nurses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Viewing these plantations as a whole,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;we
feel quite justified in representing to your Lordships that not only is
their state such as to merit approval, but having reference to their
regularity, <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>growth, and prospective ultimate development, they are not
surpassed by any Forest property in the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst the condition of the Forest of Dean was being thus canvassed, its
management had been entrusted to Mr. Brown; but after a few months he was
removed, and at the particular request of Government he was succeeded by
Mr. Machen, until a permanent arrangement should be made, which was not,
however, before the 11th of November, when the office was conferred on Sir
James Campbell, Bart., heretofore Deputy-Surveyor of Bere and Parkhurst
Forests, and now selected for the ability he had shown in their
management.&nbsp; The Treasury Letter announcing his appointment also
states that &ldquo;after the satisfactory opinion conveyed in the Report of
Messrs. Matthews, Menzies, and Murton regarding the system of management
heretofore followed in this Forest, the time has come when Mr. Machen may
be honourably relieved from the charge which he so long ably fulfilled, and
which he resumed at the request of this Board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this year (1854) no less than 4,982 acres 1 rood 20 poles of
plantation were thrown open, comprising the enclosures of Haywood, Edge
Hills, Ruerdean Hill, and Aston Bridge.&nbsp; The following licences were
likewise granted:&mdash;To the Messrs. Kingsford for constructing a length
of tramway connecting the Woodside Colliery with a terminus to be formed at
Church-way; to Messrs. Allaway for making a tramroad from the Plumphill to
their iron-mine at Wigpool; to Messrs. Davis, Cooper, and Roberts to open a
brickyard, and to sink additional iron-pits at Cinderford, Clearwell, and
Lamb&rsquo;s Quay.</p>
<p>In 1855 information was sought to be procured as to the expediency of
removing the dead wood from growing oak-trees.&nbsp; The practice hitherto
had been not to do so, a course of which a large number of timber
merchants, whose known experience justified their being consulted,
expressed their unanimous approval, declaring it far better to leave its
removal to nature.&nbsp; Another interesting investigation was now also
instituted, <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>relative to the suitableness of the Deodara pine as a Forest
tree.&nbsp; Upwards of 120,000 plants had been raised from seed, supplied
by the East India Company, in four private nurseries, half of which were
distributed in Dean Forest and the New and Delamere Forests; but it is yet
too early to afford any definite results.&nbsp; The young plants, however,
appear to be particularly susceptible to frost.</p>
<p>On the 31st of March in this year the Hon. James Kenneth Howard was
appointed one of the Chief Commissioners to administer the affairs of the
Royal Forests, the Hon. Charles Gore having for some time, after Mr.
Kennedy&rsquo;s retirement, been the sole Commissioner.</p>
<p>Three additional coal-mines, called Richard White&rsquo;s Colliery,
Hollow Meadow ditto, and Ruardean ditto, besides an iron-mine, called
Maxwell and Brooklyn Mine, were now granted, besides six stone-quarries and
another brickyard.&nbsp; Licence was also granted to Messrs. Crawshay to
connect their extensive colliery at Light Moore with the main line of
railway near Cinderford, on the broad gauge principle, besides four other
licences to connect various other works with the chief lines of traffic by
short lengths of tramway.</p>
<p>It may be here remarked, that two years previously an inspector was
appointed to view the timber intended to be felled for the navy before its
being cut, and the following table exhibits the proportion of timber
received at the Dockyard before and since the adoption of such a plan,
showing its great utility:&mdash;</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 22nd of January, 1856, an important meeting took place
at the Speech-house, Sir J. Campbell taking the chair, assisted by the Rev.
H. W. Bellairs, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector of Schools, with the object
of attempting to raise the standard of teaching in the <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>schools of the
district, eighteen in number, the Crown contributing to the support of each
of them.&nbsp; The meeting was largely attended, especially by the
neighbouring clergy, and resulted in a period of five years being allowed
to the managers of such schools to secure the services of certificated or
registered teachers, and to adopt a scale of payments by the children,
graduated according to the rental or rateable value of the tenements
occupied by their parents.&nbsp; The formation of a central school, adapted
for educating youths for filling responsible situations in the iron and
coal works of the Forest, was likewise recommended, and is obviously
desirable.&nbsp; Changes were also now made, with a view to economy, in the
staff of woodmen and labourers on the Forest, whereby an annual saving,
both immediate and prospective, would be obtained.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few decayed timber trees being felled in the
course of the following year (1857), there is nothing requiring further
notice, and I therefore here close the historical account of the Forest,
and shall proceed in the following chapters with the other objects of
inquiry which have been indicated.</p>
<h2><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>The heading of this chapter refers to one of the most interesting
circumstances connected with the Forest of Dean, namely, the origin,
character, customs, and early condition of its people.</p>
<p>The original occupiers of this part of the kingdom, according to Richard
of Cirencester, a writer of the 14th century, were the Silures, an offshoot
of the immense Celtic family by which the middle and western parts of
Europe were overspread.&nbsp; The numerous remains left in the district by
the Romans indicate that there had been considerable intercourse between
them and the inhabitants; but the chief influences of which any traces are
left appear to have descended from the Welsh, with whom the foresters of
the present day still seem closely to assimilate.&nbsp; Hence their
somewhat impulsive temperament, and the occurrence of Celtic or Silurian
names, such as the following, indicative of the character of the places
they designate:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Dean&nbsp; <i>i.e.</i> Woodland.<br />
Lidney&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; Broadwater.<br />
Awre&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; yellowish.<br />
Bicknor&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; above the river.<br />
Lydbrook&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; a river&rsquo;s shore.<br />
Penyard&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; the hill-top, &amp;c.</p>
<p>There are also many families bearing the Welsh names of Williams,
Morgan, Pritchard, Watkins, Roberts, Gwilliam, Hughes, Jenkins, Griffiths,
Lewellyn, &amp;c.&nbsp; The list of the forty-eight free miners
constituting the jury who signed the Book of Mine Laws some 400 years ago,
containing so few of those which are now most common in the neighbourhood,
indicates a considerable change as having taken place in the population;
they may be thus classed:</p>
<p><i>Not now to be found on the roll of free miners</i>&mdash;Garone,
Clarke, Wytt, Nortone, Mitchell, Lumbart, Ocle, Barton, Heynes, Arminger,
Rogers, Hathen, Miller, Croudfell, Dull, Loofe, Forthey, Walker, Tinker,
Witch, Delewger, Doles, Hinde, Tellow, Backstar, Lawrence, Dolet, Caloe,
Holt; in place of which names the following now occur&mdash;Baldwin, Cook,
Dobbs, Hale, Jenkins, Kear, Morgan, Philipps, Harper, Davis, Meek, Brain,
Jones, Jordan, Robins, Rudge, James, Milnes, Marfell, Chivers,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The names of Hathway, Skin, Baker, Holder, and Warr still
appear in the Forest, although they no longer occur on the rolls of free
miners.</p>
<p><i>Yet to be found on the rolls</i>&mdash;Preeste, Smith, Addis, Burt,
Hopkine, Tyler, Roberts, Parsons.</p>
<p>Similar traces of Saxon or Norman influence appear in the words
Staunton, Newnham, Newland, Ayleford, Coleford, &amp;c.; those of a Norman
stamp being apparent in St. Briavel&rsquo;s, Ruerdean (<i>i.e.</i>
rivi&egrave;re Dean), Lea, Coverham (Covert), &amp;c., or in the family
names of Baldwin, Waldwin, Chivers, &amp;c.&nbsp; To which may be added the
circumstance that in most of the ancient churches adjoining the Forest
there are portions of Early Norman, viz., Newnham, Staunton, English
Bicknor, Ruerdean, Woolaston, St. Briavel&rsquo;s, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Assuming that &ldquo;the customs and franchises&rdquo; of the <!-- page
145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>miners of
the Forest were first granted to the inhabitants by William I., they
certainly show, for that early period, a highly creditable appreciation of
justice, order, and right feeling.&nbsp; Their skill in the use of the bow,
and in excavating the soil, is proved by the attendance demanded of them at
various sieges during the first half of the 14th century; but their
outrageous interruption of vessels navigating the Severn in the reign of
Henry VI., and in one instance even so late as in that of George III.,
illustrates the common truth that &ldquo;every field has its
tares.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably the troubles of the Great Rebellion would have
little affected them, had they been left to themselves, their warmth of
feeling being chiefly manifested when they apprehended danger to their
&ldquo;customs and franchises:&rdquo;&mdash;hence Dr. Parsons&rsquo;s
character of them:&mdash;&ldquo;The inhabitants are some of them a sort of
robustic wild people, that must be civilized by good discipline and
government.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was no doubt their state and condition 150
years ago.&nbsp; In 1808 they were described as &ldquo;not very
orderly;&rdquo; in 1810 as being in a condition &ldquo;nearly as wretched
as anything now existing in Ireland,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;exceedingly
excitable,&rdquo; prone to make unlimited demands in opening and carrying
on their works, destroying the timber for such purposes, so as ultimately
to leave hardly a tithe for the supply of the Royal dockyards, perpetually
at strife amongst themselves, so jealous of any &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo;
coming into the Forest as to deter most persons, and highly suspicious of
any efforts to improve the property of the Crown, even when intended for
their personal good, repeatedly destroying the new plantations, and
terrifying the adjoining districts by forming riotous mobs.&nbsp; Yet the
Chartists from Newport and places adjacent, in 1840, met with no sympathy
from the Foresters, who drove their delegates away.</p>
<p>Happily for all parties these evils have almost entirely disappeared,
through the good success which Providence has vouchsafed to the late
judicious laws for regulating the mines, settling the relief of the poor,
and establishing churches and schools in every part of the <!-- page
146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>Forest.&nbsp; The former state of things was in fact the effect
of the exclusive and protective rights, with corresponding usages, of which
the well-meaning but short-sighted inhabitants thought so much; and hence
their Magna Charta, as they were wont to call their book of
&ldquo;Dennis,&rdquo; was rather a mischief than a benefit.&nbsp; Their
general feelings are characteristically described in the following lines
from the pen of worthy Kitty Drew, the self-taught Forest poetess, in her
poem on the Forest of Dean, dated 1835:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In days of old &rsquo;twas here and there a cot,<br />
Of architecture they&rsquo;d little knowledge got;<br />
None but a few free miners then lived here,<br />
Who thought no harm to catch a good fat deer,<br />
Or steal an oak&mdash;it was their chief delight.<br />
Old foresters, I&rsquo;m told, did think &rsquo;twas right<br />
To steal an oak, and bear it clean away;<br />
But caught, the jail a twelvemonth and a day<br />
It was their doom, or else must pay a fine,<br />
The which to do they did not much incline.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;But noble miners there have been, I ken,<br />
By their old works, stout, able-bodied men;<br />
They&rsquo;d not the knowledge then that now they&rsquo;ve got,<br />
To work by steam&mdash;hand-labour was their lot.<br />
But I am told that many ages back<br />

<p>A mining population is generally found to have peculiar customs and
privileges of its own, and such is more especially the case with the free
miners of the Forest of Dean, who have had hitherto their own Court of
Justice, with the exclusive occupation of the district, and the sole
control of its mineral wealth.&nbsp; Their claims are thus specified by the
Dean Forest Commissioners:&mdash;&ldquo;Every free miner duly qualified by
birth from a free father in the hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s and abiding
therein, having worked in the mines a year and a day, claims the right to
demand of the King&rsquo;s gaveller a &lsquo;gale,&rsquo; that is a spot of
ground chosen by himself for sinking a mine, and this, provided it does not
interfere with the works of any other mine, the gaveller considers himself
obliged to give, receiving a fee of five shillings, and inserting the name
of the free miner in the gale-book.&nbsp; The gaveller goes to the spot
selected with the free miner making the application, and gives him
possession with the following ceremonies:&mdash;The gaveller cuts a stick,
and, asking the party how many verns or partners he has, cuts a notch for
every partner, and one for the King.&nbsp; A turf is then cut, and the
stick forked down by two other sticks, the turf put over it, and the party
galing the work is then considered to be put in full possession.&nbsp; The
free miner, having thus obtained possession, is compelled to proceed with
the work by working one day in the following year and day, and a day in
each subsequent year and day (forfeiting the gale if he fails so to work),
and to pay an annual sum of two guineas to the gaveller for each vein of
coal he intends to work, till he gets at <!-- page 148--><a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>the coal, after which
he agrees with him for the amount of the composition to be paid to the King
in lieu of his fifth, which, in case of their not agreeing, must be taken
in kind by the King&rsquo;s putting in a fifth man.&nbsp; The right to the
gale is considered by the free miner to carry with it that of timber for
the use of the works; this seems to extend no farther than to the offal and
soft wood; and the mode of obtaining it is for the miner to apply to the
keeper of the walk in which his mine is situated for an order, which he
takes to the clerk of the Swainmote Court, who, on receiving a fee of one
shilling, as a matter of course gives him another order directed to the
keeper of the walk in which there is timber fit for the purpose,&rdquo; in
the following form:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Copy of a Warrant or Order for the Delivery of Timber to a Coal Miner
in Dean Forest</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Forest of Dean.]&nbsp; At the Court of Attachments, holden at
the Speech House, the 25th day of Sep. 1784, came Phil. Hatton, and
demanded Timber for himself and Verns, for the Use of their Coal Works
called Young Colliers, in Ruerdean Walk, within the said Forest.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jno.</span> <span
class="smcap">Matthews</span>, Steward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mr. John Bradley, Keeper of the said Walk.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  (by Certificate.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Timber to be delivered fit for sinking.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indorsed &lsquo;4
Oaks.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The miner cuts the timber when assigned, and until within about
the last ten years paid a fee of two shillings to the keeper, there being
no limit to the amount of timber if applied for the use of the works.&nbsp;
If the gale-ground was situated within the hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s,
but belonged to private parties, the free miner still claimed his right to
open the ground, the proprietor being let in as a partner, making a sixth,
the only exception being churchyards, gardens, orchards, and Crown
plantations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A jury of twelve, twenty-four, forty-eight, or seventy free miners,
under the auspices of the Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, or his
deputy, enacted such mine laws <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>as the interests of the body seemed to
require, administering them without any appeal, or permission to resort to
another court of law.&nbsp; The witnesses in giving evidence wore their
caps to show that they were free miners, and took the usual oath, touching
the Book of the Four Gospels with a stick of holly, <a
name="citation149a"></a><a href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a>
so as not to soil the Sacred Volume with their miry hands.&nbsp; These
singular usages explain the observation of the Rev. H. Berkin that
&ldquo;the inhabitants are completely <i>sui generis</i>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;their exact situation can scarcely be understood except by those on
the spot,&rdquo; as likewise the sentiment which the Rev. H. C. H. Hawkins
expresses&mdash;&ldquo;by altering the character of the Foresters, a
curious relic of antiquity might be destroyed, to my regret I must own, as
I feel desirous to preserve so singular a specimen in all its
purity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1832 the Rev. C. Crawley stated, &ldquo;I think the moral
character of the inhabitants has been much improved by the building of
churches; heinous offences are very rare in the Forest:&rdquo; and in 1849
Mr. Machen said, &ldquo;A great change has been wrought in them; there is a
very great difference in their habits now, certainly.&rdquo; <a

<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>The Forest miners of the present day are well acquainted with the
geological structure of their neighbourhood, more especially with the
out-crop, succession, and dip of the mineral veins.&nbsp; In short, their
natural endowments are fully equal to the general standard, and only
require cultivation, as frequently appears from the quickness with which
they detect the bearings of any pecuniary transaction, and their proneness
to litigation.&nbsp; Many superstitions, however, still linger amongst
them, such as the use of charms and incantations, a belief in witchcraft
and an evil eye, a resort to &ldquo;wise men,&rdquo; and even to the
minister of the parish as being a &ldquo;Master of Arts,&rdquo; or for some
of the offertory money, out of which to have a charm-ring made.&nbsp; They
are likewise inclined to give credence to tales of apparitions, and to
regard sickness and accident as fated and inevitable.&nbsp; From their
having been for so many generations an isolated and peculiar people, most
of them are ignorant of the rest of the world, and have of course a
correspondingly exaggerated idea of their own importance.&nbsp; It is
pleasing to observe the sympathy they manifest towards the sick amongst
them, or such as have been accidentally injured; and although most
independent in their notions, and impatient of <!-- page 151--><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>control, they seem
always thankful for real kindness.&nbsp; What they chiefly lack is more
generosity and candour towards strangers, and a clearer understanding of
their duties as protectors of the national property, in respect of the
crops of timber which grow around them. <a name="citation151"></a><a
href="#footnote151" class="citation">[151]</a>&nbsp; In most mining
districts the moral habits of the people are more or less in a low state,
and they are certainly not worse here than elsewhere.&nbsp; One source of
evil arises from the large ablutions which their working underground
necessitates.&nbsp; The process of washing on their return from the pit is
not performed as privately as it might be, and the effect of this upon the
moral perceptions of the people, huddled together in their small cottages,
is very injurious.&nbsp; It is a pity some arrangement is not made for
having washhouses at the pits, where a supply of hot water from the boilers
might be easily obtained for the purpose.</p>
<p>One half of the Forest population is understood to be employed at the
coal-works, a fourth part at those of iron, whose red dresses make them
easily known, and the remaining portion are employed in the quarries and
woods, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Horses of a bad breed, donkeys, mules, cattle, sheep, pigs, and geese
abound, owing to the free pasture afforded by the open Forest, the three
former having been used for many generations in carrying iron-mine, coal,
charcoal, &amp;c.&nbsp; Farming operations are necessarily very
limited.&nbsp; Cider obtained from the styre apple used to be a common
beverage; but that fruit has long been extinct, and malt-liquor is now
mostly preferred.&nbsp; Gardening is little attended to, the colliers
generally feeling indisposed to further exertion after returning from the
pit.&nbsp; In few instances only are bees kept.&nbsp; Formerly much of the
wearing apparel was made from home-spun wool, woven or knitted in the
neighbourhood; but this is not now the practice.</p>
<p>The turf-covered cabin, resting on four dry walls, without windows, and
pierced only by a low door, with <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>a very rude fireplace
and chimney in &ldquo;the pine end,&rdquo; and partially paved with rough
stones, once the habitation of the Forest &ldquo;cabiner,&rdquo; is now
almost entirely superseded by two-floored cottages, often containing not
less than four apartments.&nbsp; In bygone days a few neighbours, taking
advantage of a moonlight night, accomplished the erection of a cabin ere
the morning dawned, in which case it was supposed that the keepers had no
power to pull it down.&nbsp; To show the eagerness with which poor families
sought to establish themselves in the Forest, it may be mentioned that they
took possession of the ancient mine-caves, walling up the back and front,
leaving a vent for the smoke in the former, and in the latter a gap as an
entrance.</p>
<p>Their pastimes used to be dancing and foot-ball, to the great delight of
people of all ages: indeed there are several spots yet called from the
above circumstance &ldquo;the dancing green.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wakes were
likewise very popular, and also the game of fives, so that at Ruerdean one
side of the church tower was whitewashed for the purpose, and resorted to
even on Sundays.&nbsp; Some of the provincialisms of the district occur in
the following words&mdash;&ldquo;yat&rdquo; (gate), &ldquo;tump&rdquo;
(hillock), &ldquo;teart&rdquo; (sharp), &ldquo;spract&rdquo; (lively),
&ldquo;twich&rdquo; (touch), &ldquo;near a anoust&rdquo; (near the same),
&ldquo;anunt&rdquo; (opposite).</p>
<p>Peculiarities also occur in the selection of Christian names, including
these&mdash;Benedicta, Abia, Winifred, Kezia, Barzillai, Sibylla, Eve,
Saba, Sabina, Beata, Tryphena, Belinda, Myra, Terzah, Nimrod, River,
Milson, Miles, &amp;c. <a name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a></p>
<p>On account of the dense woods with which the Forest was anciently
covered, added to the fact that except at Newland, and perhaps at Park End,
no churches were <!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>built within it, we may conclude that at an
early period its population was small, the persons engaged in the iron and
coal works then living, as many of the working people do now, in the
adjoining parishes.&nbsp; Our earliest information as to the number of
inhabitants residing within its present limits relates to the time of the
Commonwealth, when &ldquo;400 cabins of beggarly people living upon the
waste, and destroying the wood and timber, were thrown down.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1712 Sir R. Atkins states that &ldquo;there had been many cottages in
it, but that they had been lately pulled down, leaving only the six
keepers&rsquo; houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gives 6,090 as the total population
of the outlying parishes, thus distributed:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the close of the century, the Forest, as now bounded, comprised 589
houses, which in 1803 had increased to 696, the number of free miners being
then 662.&nbsp; Since that time the inhabitants of the Forest have gone on
increasing as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1821 they were&nbsp; 5,525<br />
In 1831&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; 7,014<br />
In 1841&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; 10,674<br />
In 1851&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; 13,252</p>
<p>of whom about 1,789 have the right of voting for Members of
Parliament.&nbsp; The annual value of property existing in the Forest, not
belonging to the Crown, was estimated in 1849 at &pound;13,603 14s. 2d.,
and in 1856 at &pound;18,492 17s. 7d.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Previous to the Reformation, care seems to have been taken to provide
the population of the Forest with the means of religious worship.&nbsp; The
border churches of Mitcheldean and Newland were far larger than the people
residing in their immediate neighbourhood required; and there were others,
of which the memorials only remain in the names of &ldquo;Chapel
Hill&rdquo; and &ldquo;Church Hill,&rdquo; the former in the parish of
English Bicknor, and the latter at Park End.&nbsp; This last was connected
apparently with Ruerdean, if we may judge from the &ldquo;Churchway&rdquo;
which ran in that direction and gave the name to an adjacent
colliery.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Laws and Customes&rdquo; of the free miners,
dating as far back certainly as the year 1300, show that the services of
the Church were then generally known&mdash;the King&rsquo;s Gaveller being
therein directed to visit the mine &ldquo;between Mattens and Masse,&rdquo;
and the miner was to &ldquo;swear by his faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; For 200 years
after the Reformation no further provision was made, indeed none was
apparently required, as the Forest had been more than once nearly
depopulated during that period, and was said to be almost without
inhabitants in 1712.</p>
<p>In common with many other mineral districts, especially those in the
West, the Rev. John Wesley established a connection with our Forest
miners.&nbsp; He visited Coleford as early as 1756, and did so again in
1763; and his Journal thus records these visits:&mdash;<!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>&ldquo;Monday, 15th
March, 1756.&mdash;We reached Coleford before seven, and found a plain
loving people, who received the word of God with all gladness.&nbsp;
Tuesday, 16th.&mdash;Examining the little society, I found them grievously
harassed by disputations.&nbsp; Anabaptists were on one side, and Quakers
on the other; and hereby five or six persons have been confused.&nbsp; But
the rest cleave so much the closer together.&nbsp; Nor does it appear that
there is now one trifler, much less a disorderly walker, among
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wednesday, 17th (August, 1763).&mdash;&ldquo;Hence we
rode to Coleford.&nbsp; The wind being high, I consented to preach in their
new room; but large as it was, it would not contain the people, who
appeared to be not a little affected, of which they gave a sufficient proof
by filling the room at five in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears, also, as stated in the interesting MS. of worthy Mr.
Horlich, an Independent Minister, that in the year 1783 &ldquo;one Mr.
Stiff occasionally, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, went to some sequestered spot
in the Forest, where himself and some of his family took their station
under the extended branches of one of the trees, for the purpose of reading
the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no sustained effort to impart religious instruction to the
inhabitants of the Forest was made until 1803, when the Rev. P. M. Procter
became Vicar of Newland, to which parish the Foresters were always
considered to belong.&nbsp; &ldquo;At this time,&rdquo; he says, in his
&lsquo;Brief and Authentic Statement,&rsquo; published in 1819, &ldquo;I
saw nothing of them on the Sabbath-day.&nbsp; The church was only used by
them as a matter of course and necessity: indeed, a general opinion
prevailed that they had no right to accommodation, and a Forester was
seldom seen in the aisle.&nbsp; The first impression I received respecting
the inhabitants was of the most unfavourable kind.&nbsp; For some months no
other intercourse took place than what the visiting of the sick and the
baptizing of the children occasioned.&nbsp; By these means, however, I came
to the knowledge of their condition, their lives and conversation, of which
the latter were the most deplorable&mdash;habitual profanation <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of the
Sabbath-day, drunkenness, rioting, immodest dancing, revellings, fightings,
an improper state of females on their marriage, and an absence and
ignorance of the Holy Scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Procter then goes on to relate how he was brought to attempt their
improvement.&mdash;&ldquo;After a few months&rsquo; residence I was invited
to take the afternoon duty of the chapel at Coleford.&nbsp; Curiosity
brought some of the colliers to hear, and the report they carried home with
them induced others to come and judge for themselves.&nbsp; We passed on
very quietly for a little time, when a collier, named Thomas Morgan, sent
to request that I would call upon him.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp; After the
accustomed salutations were passed, he assigned certain impressive reasons
for wishing to see me, and, in stating them, his eyes, his voice, and
humble gesture strongly marked the agitated feelings of his soul.&nbsp;
After an interesting conversation of two hours, I promised, at his request,
to call upon him again the following week.&nbsp; On taking my leave he
said, &lsquo;I hope your honour will not be offended, but some of my
relations and neighbours are in the same ignorant state as myself; they
would be happy to hear your conversation, and with permission I will ask
one or two to come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Under the impression of a private
conversation with six or eight people, I went to the cottage at the time
appointed.&nbsp; Upon laying my hand on the latch of the door, the opening
of it was prevented&mdash;the resistance proceeded from the number of
people collected within.&nbsp; A profound silence prevailed.&nbsp; The
collier smiled and looked for a pardon.&nbsp; Astonished at this unexpected
scene, not being accustomed and perfectly unprepared to address such an
assemblage, I felt for some moments at a loss how to proceed.&nbsp; But
there was no time for hesitation; taking the Bible, the 61st of Isaiah was
the chapter read and commented upon.&nbsp; The attention with which the
poor heard, the very humble manner in which they returned thanks, and the
earnest hope they expressed that I would come again, made a deep impression
in their favour.&nbsp; Under these circumstances I was led, <!-- page
157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>as it were,
unintentionally to the commencement of those lectures which continue to the
present time (1819).&nbsp; The first effects of these lectures were seen in
the observance of the sacred duties of the Sabbath-day; our congregations
at Newland increased, and the aisles of the church became occupied, in
which the Foresters were now seen.&nbsp; Year after year passed away, the
Thursday evening lectures continued to be well attended, the moral habits
of the people improved, and a knowledge of the Scriptures obtained.&nbsp;
Religion had evidently taken root; much was effected, but infinitely more
remained to be done.&nbsp; The means only were wanting&mdash;the
opportunity was present.&nbsp; <i>Could we raise a building to contain
about 200 people</i>?&nbsp; Such were our limited views at that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1807 a memorial was drawn up and signed by some hundreds of miners
and colliers, praying the officers of the Crown to grant a portion of land
on which to erect a lecture-room, and also timber for building it.&nbsp;
Dr. Huntingford, the Bishop of Gloucester, presented the petition to
Government; but the law officers of the Crown, Sir S. Romilly and Sir A.
Piggott, found that it could not be carried into effect without an Act of
the Legislature.&nbsp; Under Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s administration, Mr.
Procter renewed the attempt by a personal interview with that minister,
who, whilst expressing his deep regret that he could not officially assist,
suggested an appeal to the public, to which he would give his name and
support, as well as an application to the National Society about to be
formed.&nbsp; To him, in fact, is due the insertion at this juncture of the
clause in the Act of 52nd George III., chap. 161, sec. 27, to enable the
Commissioners of the Treasury to appropriate small portions of land, not
exceeding five acres, for ecclesiastical purposes, and which has
facilitated the erection of the Forest churches.</p>
<p>Closely resembling the above efforts were those made on the north-east
side of the Forest by the Rev. H. Berkin, which he commenced about the year
1809, when curate of Mitcheldean.&nbsp; He writes&mdash;&ldquo;Finding the
miners and colliers of the Forest, adjoining that <!-- page 158--><a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>parish, too generally
living in the neglect of moral and religious duties, I considered it a duty
to attempt their improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp; In January, 1812, he opened a
school-room in Mitcheldean, which he had built mainly at his own expense,
although he was afterwards assisted by his private friends, and in
particular by a liberal donation from the Duke of Beaufort, and eventually
by a grant of &pound;50 from the National Society, &pound;100 being given
at the same time to Mr. Procter&rsquo;s building-fund&mdash;these were the
very first donations to country schools made by that estimable
institution.&nbsp; Mr. Berkin&rsquo;s school was at once attended by 140
scholars, and ultimately 350 came.&nbsp; In the first Report of the
National Society it is stated that &ldquo;many of the parents expressed
their acknowledgments to Mr. Berkin with the tears in their eyes, exerting
themselves to the utmost to enable their children to be constant in their
attendance, in spite of the numerous difficulties with which they had to
struggle&mdash;such as the distance of the schools, the wretched state of
the roads in bad weather, and the extreme poverty of the people, which
makes it a hard matter for them to clothe their children properly, and to
furnish them with a slice of bread for their dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to Mr. Procter&rsquo;s exertions to erect a building for the
two-fold purpose of divine service and juvenile instruction, he found
consolation for former disappointments in the following pleasing offer of
Thomas Morgan, the poor cottager already mentioned:&mdash;&ldquo;Take my
field,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;With that I give you five guineas, to
which my neighbours have added &pound;15.&nbsp; We ask of you only to begin
and build until the money is expended; in another year we will again add
our mites; only lay the foundation and begin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, in
the month of June, 1812, the building was commenced, and (aided by the
subscriptions which were received, especially from the Duke of Beaufort,
the Lord Bishop of Gloucester, and his secretary, Mr. Ryder) was so
constructed as to admit of its being hereafter enlarged and
consecrated.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the Epiphany, 6th January, 1813, the public
service of the Established <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Church was, for the first time, read within
its walls, under the authority of an episcopal licence; but on the
commencement of Sunday duty a painful circumstance presented itself which
had not been anticipated, viz. an astonishing inattention to the prayers of
the Church: all appeared a blank&mdash;no interest, no spiritual
concern.&nbsp; The cause was evident in the want of prayer-books, soon
however supplied by the Society for promoting Christian Knowledge, and one
of the bishops of the Church.&nbsp; A schoolmaster, Mr. Edward Hawkins,
previously sent to the National School in Baldwin&rsquo;s Gardens,
immediately commenced the education of the children&mdash;300 being entered
the first week.&nbsp; On every Thursday evening throughout the year the
scholars were examined in the presence of a congregation assembled for
public worship&mdash;a mode of instruction which gave a laudable excitement
to the children, by means of which they acquired a firmness of mind, a
clear, distinct pronunciation, and an accuracy in their delivery, which was
very gratifying to the hearers, whilst it gave to the parents and relations
an opportunity of observing their progress by the system of
education.&nbsp; Through this medium, also, many a truth has been taught,
many an impression made, where preaching had not succeeded.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;By this time,&rdquo; proceeds the same excellent man, &ldquo;the
principles and motives of my exertions being made apparent, all the little
prejudices were softened down, if not into approval, at least into a
passive silence, particularly as another clergyman, the Rev. H. Berkin, was
zealously pursuing the same line of conduct on the other side of the
Forest, who began this year (1812) to lecture in the cottages there, as his
next attempt to benefit the parents and children connected with his
school.&rdquo;&nbsp; He says&mdash;&ldquo;Finding that few, by comparison,
attended public worship, I visited them in their cottages to read and
explain the Bible; and I was led to adopt this plan from the particular
situation of the Foresters, destitute of churches or ministers whom they
could properly call their own.&nbsp; In these pastoral visits, made on
different evenings in different places, and <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>in which I have
usually spent two hours in reading and practically explaining the Holy
Scriptures, I have sometimes had 200 persons present at one time, and
calculate on the whole that 800 at different times have thus come under
instruction.&nbsp; Many instances might be produced, certainly not less
than 20 families, of reformation in both sexes, which had evinced itself in
their desire to possess the Bible and Common Prayer Book, and by a total
change in their moral character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the commencement of his career Mr. Berkin was repeatedly remonstrated
with by respectable gentlemen who knew the locality better than himself,
upon his venturing amongst the Foresters alone, assuring him that it was
not safe, since, a very short time before he came to Mitcheldean, two
Wesleyan ministers attempted open-air preaching in the Forest, but were
violently attacked and driven away.&nbsp; He thus proceeds to describe the
circumstances which led to the erection of Holy Trinity
Church:&mdash;&ldquo;At one of the places which I am accustomed to visit,
where the heat and crowd have at times been almost insufferable, the
colliers, aided by two or three neighbouring farmers, offered to build a
large room for the better accommodation of greater numbers.&nbsp; This, for
obvious reasons, was declined; but it led me earnestly to wish that the
Foresters might be more immediately brought within the pale of the
Established Church, and, by regular attendance on a church appropriated to
themselves, be made habitually acquainted with that admirable Liturgy to
which too many of them are now utter strangers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acting upon
these earnest feelings, Mr. Berkin, with the concurrence of the esteemed
Dr. Ryder, the Bishop of Gloucester, laid a memorial and plan before
Government, with an offer, on his part, that, &ldquo;if the needful fund
for building a church and parsonage-house could be provided, he would give
up his present curacy and serve the new church without any further
emolument than the endowment necessary for its consecration.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the concluding terms of an admirable address to the public, dated the
30th April, 1816, which he circulated <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>with the design of
obtaining contributions to the work, he stated&mdash;&ldquo;My wishes are,
that the kind contributors will feel rewarded in the reflection that
thousands yet unborn may have cause to bless them for thus providing for
their spiritual wants, and giving them the knowledge of those principles
which alone can make them worthy members of society here, or lead them to
provide well for their eternal welfare hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crown granted five acres of land for the purpose on Harry Hill,
being a spot situated within a reasonable distance of from 250 to 300
cottages.&nbsp; To the estimated cost of &pound;2,500, contributions,
amounting in some cases to &pound;30 each, were given by the Earl of
Liverpool, Right Hon. N. Vansittart, the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort, Sir
Thomas Baring, Lord Calthorpe, Joshua Watson, Esq., Rev. H. H. Norris, W.
Wilberforce, Esq., M.P., Rev. J. Pratt, &amp;c.&nbsp; The building of the
church (the design of which comprised a chancel 15 feet square, a tower
about 60 feet high, and a body or nave 40 feet by 60 feet, calculated to
hold from 400 to 500 adults, and a large children&rsquo;s gallery, for whom
a school-room 30 feet by 50 feet was also to be built close adjoining) was
begun on the 4th of June, 1816, and was used for the first time upon the
2nd of February following, on which occasion the sermon was preached by the
Rev. Edward Bickersteth, from St. Matt. iv. 16.&nbsp; It was consecrated,
as the Church of the Holy Trinity, by Bishop Ryder, on the 26th June, 1817,
who preached a sermon, not yet forgotten, upon 1 Kings viii. 30; and the
whole property of the living was vested in the Lord Bishop of Gloucester,
Lord Calthorpe, and the Right Hon. Nicholas Vansittart, Rev. J. Kempthorne
and Rev. Charles Bryan, as trustees.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Berkin had thus accomplished the important object of
providing the inhabitants of the north-east portion of the Forest with
&ldquo;a church which they could call their own,&rdquo; he felt that it yet
remained for him to make the building really useful to the people by
imparting to them more and more just views of the Christian life.&nbsp;
Accordingly he laboured <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>if possible more abundantly than ever amongst
them, visiting their houses at short intervals, collecting neighbours
together, and expounding the Holy Scripture to them under their own roofs,
or else opening the church so as to draw them off from the corrupting
pastimes which were common at certain times of the year, and bestowing much
pains on his Sunday school.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Holy Trinity Church and Schools, Harry Hill"
src="images/p162.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Sometimes, when necessitated to take relaxation, and to go from home for
a few weeks, he improved the time by acting as a deputation for the Church
Missionary or Bible Societies, and even now his name is remembered <!--
page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>in
distant parishes.&nbsp; The Missionary Association for which he acted as
secretary, and which was called the North-east Forest of Dean Branch,
sometimes contributed &pound;220 a year to the cause, or a total of
&pound;3,300.&nbsp; The appliances, now so generally known, for interesting
the young were even then in actual operation in his own school, and
effected their purpose well.&nbsp; His monitors and sub-teachers were
carefully guided by him; and no doubt with the design of duly impressing
its importance upon his scholars, holy baptism in accordance with the
rubric was always administered during divine service, after the second
lesson, and this took place most Sundays, as the register shows.</p>
<p>Few clergymen took more pains than Mr. Berkin with the communicants of
the church, who were always visited before the communion day, and who
generally presented themselves to the number of about seventy.&nbsp; On two
occasions valuable livings were offered to him; but, said he, &ldquo;since
my ministerial work began in this neighbourhood, here it shall end,&rdquo;
as it accordingly did, after forty years of labour, on the 11th October,
1847.&nbsp; He was buried in his own churchyard, being followed to the
grave by his sorrowing people, and worthily committed to the tomb by the
Rev. James Davies, of Abbenhall.&nbsp; His funeral sermon was preached by
the Rev. H. Poole, who took for his text 2 Tim. iv. 6&ndash;8. <a
name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163"
class="citation">[163]</a></p>
<p>A rapidly increasing population, and unfortunately not a concentrating
one, compelled Mr. Berkin&rsquo;s successor (the writer of this work) to
meet its wants by erecting chapel school-rooms, for the accommodation of
sixty scholars each, in the hamlets of Woodside and the Hawthorns, the
former having been in use since 15th September, 1850, and the latter since
31st December, 1851, to the lasting benefit, he trusts, of many of the
rising generation through the Divine blessing on the conscientious efforts
of their respective teachers.&nbsp; It <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>was by such a method
that Mr. Berkin acted, when, in the year 1822, he caused a chapel
school-room to be built at Lydbrook, judging that place to be sufficiently
populous and distant from the nearest church to justify such an erection,
not as being a full provision for it, but hoping that eventually a church
might be built there, which has now been satisfactorily accomplished.</p>
<p>The following clergymen have successively officiated in the district of
Holy Trinity:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Incumbents</i>.&mdash;H. Berkin, 1817; H. G. Nicholls, 1847.</p>
<p><i>Curates</i>.&mdash;J. Morse, 1820; J. Bridgeman, 1821; J. Herbert,
1822; W. Marshall, 1822; W. Burkitt, 1824; J. Chell, 1827; R. T. Budd,
1840; W. C. Badger, 1844; J. G. Croker, 1846; G. Tatam, 1848; H. Algar,
1851; W. Nickisson; W. Duckett; J. Ashton; H. W. Thornton; W. A.
Whitestone.&nbsp; Most of these gentlemen served at Lydbrook, although
occasionally at Holy Trinity Church; they likewise attended the Chapel
Schoolroom on Little Dean Hill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The annual number of christenings at Holy Trinity Church is 80; of
weddings, 15; and of funerals, 40.&nbsp; The morning congregation on Sunday
comprises about 100; that in the afternoon, 350; and the two evening
school-room services, 120.&nbsp; About 250 scholars attend school weekdays
and Sundays.</p>
<p>Having thus related the progressive efforts made for the welfare of the
people occupying the north-east portion of the Forest, it is necessary that
we return to the date of 1813, being the year in which the Rev. Mr. Procter
opened his chapel school-room on the west.&nbsp; He tells us that &ldquo;in
the course of this year the Bishop of Gloucester was pleased to call my
attention to the clause introduced by Mr. Perceval into the Act of 52
George III., cap. 161.&nbsp; I went up to town, and had the honour of an
interview with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Right Honourable N.
Vansittart, who was pleased to advise with the Earl of Liverpool on the
subject, which resulted in a grant of five acres of land, a donation of
&pound;100 to the building fund, and an endowment of &pound;20 per annum to
the school.&rdquo;&nbsp; He proceeds to remark that &ldquo;the crowded
state of the chapel became a matter of astonishment to the Foresters
themselves, and painfully inconvenient to the <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>congregation, as well
as dangerous to the health of the officiating minister, from the intense
heat, besides excluding the children, all showing the necessity of an
enlargement; so that, after a probationary period of three years, another
appeal for aid came before the public, whereby the building was increased
to twice the size, provided with a children&rsquo;s gallery, and, excepting
two pews, kept perfectly free and open to all.&nbsp; It now became my
duty,&rdquo; observes Mr. Procter, &ldquo;to secure to the Foresters in
perpetuity these extraordinary blessings which Divine Providence was
progressively granting to them.&nbsp; This could only be done by
consecration, and to authorize such an act, an endowment being considered
necessary, another public appeal was made in June, 1813, for assistance to
place amongst these poor people a clergyman who would not only publicly
preach, but reside, privately visit their cottages, disseminate the
Scriptures, and assist the master of the National School in impressing upon
the minds of the children the principles of the Christian religion,&rdquo;
as, &ldquo;without a resident clergyman, an experience of fourteen years
convinced him that all efforts would prove abortive.&nbsp; It had likewise
become necessary to discontinue using the chapel as a school-room, since
the doing so had been found to lessen the reverence due to the sanctuary in
the minds both of the parents and children.&nbsp; A new schoolroom was
therefore immediately built of the best stone, with two fireplaces, and a
partition in the middle; over the door is the following
inscription,&mdash;&lsquo;The Forest Day School, for Boys and Girls, on the
National plan, established 1812, supported by voluntary
subscriptions.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; The cost of erection was almost
&pound;300, and the expenses of conducting the school averaged about
&pound;70 per annum, for two-thirds of which Mr. Procter was himself
answerable, and only dependent on annual donations.</p>
<p>With the view of forming such an endowment for the church as would make
it eligible for consecration, a freehold estate near at hand was purchased
in the month of November, 1816, although the price of it <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>exceeded the sum
subscribed by &pound;200, but which amount it was expected the
Parliamentary Commissioners would repay.&nbsp; Thomas Morgan&rsquo;s house,
garden, buildings, and lands adjoining the chapel were also purchased for
nearly &pound;400, the former being partly preserved in the back part of
the present parsonage-house.&nbsp; Thus the property appropriated to the
new church consisted at this time of the five acres of Crown land, the
purchased freehold, and Thomas Morgan&rsquo;s property, on which, as an
ecclesiastical endowment, the consecration of the church, under the name of
Christ Church, took place, on Wednesday, 7th July, 1816, by Bishop Ryder,
and was duly conveyed to the following gentlemen as trustees, viz., the
Right Honourable N. Vansittart, Lord Calthorpe, James Jenkins, George
Baring, T. T. Biddulph, Esqrs.; Reverends J. Hensman and E. Mansfield.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p166.jpg">
<img alt="Christ Church, Berry Hill" src="images/p166.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The body of the building forms a parallelogram 50 feet by 42 feet; the
tower, upwards of 60 feet high, was built some years afterwards, at a cost
of &pound;1,000.&nbsp; Unfortunately, serious inconvenience ensued to Mr.
Procter by his having caused the whole of the above-named endowment
property to be conveyed to the church previous to its consecration, since,
on presenting the memorial to the Board for the payment of the accustomed
Parliamentary grant, the case was pronounced &ldquo;irregular,&rdquo;
rendering Mr. Procter liable to a debt of &pound;950, although &pound;500
of the amount was eventually paid by Pyncombe&rsquo;s Charity and Queen
<!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Anne&rsquo;s Board.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;2,000 was granted,
however, by the Parliamentary Board to be laid out in the purchase of land,
yielding in the mean time an interest of &pound;4 per cent., and raising
the total income of the living to &pound;118 10s. 6d., or
thereabouts.&nbsp; Mr. Procter died on the 8th May, 1822, aged 52, worn out
by excessive devotion to his pastoral duties, and was succeeded by the Rev.
T. R. Garnsey, who, after a life of similar usefulness, expired in March,
1847.&nbsp; His funeral sermon was preached on Sunday, the 14th of March,
by the Rev. H. Poole, from Hebrews xii. 2.&nbsp; The church was densely
crowded, many could not obtain an entrance, and all appeared deeply to feel
the loss they had sustained.</p>
<p>In the mean time, under the Act of 1842, an addition of &pound;31 9s.
6d. was made to the salary of the incumbent, by the purchase of an
equivalent amount of 3 per cent. Reduced Bank Annuities, raising its annual
income to &pound;150, the nomination to the incumbency being transferred to
the Queen and her successors.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Banks succeeded to the
living in 1847, who, previous to his relinquishing it in 1852, effected
several improvements in the interior of the church.&nbsp; The Rev. W. H.
Taylor followed him, and still remains the minister.&nbsp; The adjoining
school premises have been made much more complete and capacious by him, so
as amply to accommodate 150 children, and a teacher&rsquo;s house has been
erected.&nbsp; A permanent redemption of the land-tax charged on the
living, at the cost of &pound;150, has also been presented by Thomas
Graham, Esq. There are three tablets on the north side or oldest part of
the church, to the memories of Edward Hawkins, the first teacher in the
school, the Rev. P. M. Procter, and the Rev. T. R. Garnsey, and a flat
paved stone records the grave of Thomas Morgan.&nbsp; About ten marriages,
forty-three baptisms, and thirty-five funerals take place yearly.&nbsp; The
church is well attended on Sunday, especially in the afternoon, when 300 or
400 persons are usually present.</p>
<p>Whilst the Rev. P. M. Procter and the Rev. H. Berkin were engaged in
effecting the improvements <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>described on the west and north-east sides of
the Forest, the Rev. H. Poole was labouring to accomplish similar results
on the south-east.&nbsp; The appeal for public aid towards &ldquo;the
erection of a church and school-house,&rdquo; which he issued on the 6th
July, 1819, thus forcibly describes the necessities of the
case:&mdash;&ldquo;The Forest is an extensive tract of land, having a
circumference of about twenty-five miles, and containing at present nearly
5,000 souls.&nbsp; This population, with some exceptions, may be considered
as divided into three settlements, detached from each other by a space of
several miles, of which settlements two are now provided with churches; but
the other colony, situated on the south-east side, is still destitute of
the means of religious knowledge.&nbsp; It is therefore proposed, under the
sanction of the Lord Bishop of the diocese, to erect a third church and
school-house in this still neglected spot.&nbsp; From a recent accurate
survey, it appears that within little more than two miles of the site of
the proposed church there are at least 400 inhabitants, distant from the
other Forest churches about six miles, and from any parish church nearly
three miles.&nbsp; The chapel of Bream, the nearest episcopal place of
worship, is too small to accommodate even one-third of the population of
its own tithing.&nbsp; Being thus unprovided with a place of worship and
the means of public instruction, and following the corrupt dictates of
their untutored minds, the natural consequences are gross ignorance of the
Scriptures, a shameful profanation of the Sabbath, and a total neglect of
all the duties of religion, accompanied with a general prevalence of
disorderly and immoral conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; This application met with a
generous response from Bishop Ryder, Edward Protheroe, Esq., the Earl of
Liverpool, the Right Hon. N. Vansittart, Edward Machen, Esq., Lord
Calthorpe, Lady Olivia Sparrow, Mrs. H. More, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The site chosen for the new church, as being most convenient of access
for the largest number of persons, was &ldquo;Mason&rsquo;s Tump,&rdquo;
situated immediately to the east <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>of Whitemead, Park
End.&nbsp; In the two previous instances of church-building at Berry Hill
and Holy Trinity, little had been attempted in the way of appropriate
design; but in this case Mr. Poole&rsquo;s practical knowledge and good
taste enabled more to be accomplished.&nbsp; At a total cost of
&pound;2,731, including the churchyard boundary wall and gates, a cruciform
edifice, enlarged into an octagon forty-six feet in diameter at the
intersection, having a total length of sixty-six feet, so as to accommodate
500 people, was erected in the Decorated style of architecture; attached to
which there was also raised a well-proportioned tower, eighty feet in
height, and intended to contain a small peal of eight bells, Edward Machen,
Esq., presenting the treble, as well as a good clock with three dials.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p169.jpg">
<img alt="St. Paul&rsquo;s Church, Park End" src="images/p169.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The church now possesses a good finger organ, removed from Ross church,
and said to have been used originally in Salisbury Cathedral.&nbsp; There
is also a rich reredos under the east window.&nbsp; At eleven o&rsquo;clock
on the morning of the 2nd of May, 1822, Dr. Ryder, the Lord Bishop of
Gloucester, attended by thirteen clergymen and many of the <!-- page
170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>magistrates
and gentry of the neighbourhood, proceeded to the spot for the purpose of
dedicating the fabric to the service of God as the Church of St.
Paul.&nbsp; The Bishop entered the edifice by the west door, followed by
his clergy, repeating alternately the 24th Psalm.&nbsp; Every seat was
immediately filled, and soon no spot was left unoccupied.&nbsp; Many could
not gain admission, and were seen clinging to the bars of the windows on
the outside.&nbsp; A large company of professional and amateur singers
attended, so that the whole musical part of the service was well
executed.&nbsp; His Lordship delivered an impressive discourse from the
8th, 9th, and 10th verses of the 132nd Psalm.&nbsp; The congregation was
very attentive, and, after contributing at the door nearly &pound;30
towards the completion of the work, dispersed, fully 1,000 persons being
observed to leave the church.&nbsp; The perpetual advowson of the living
was assigned to the Bishop of the diocese, and endowed with &pound;75 6s.
6d. per annum, together with the remainder of the five acres of land
granted by the Crown as glebe, on which a picturesque parsonage, and also
commodious schools for a population supposed to number 1,500, were
erected.&nbsp; By the Act of 1842 the income of the incumbency was
augmented to &pound;150 a year, and the presentation confirmed to the
Bishop of the diocese, with an ecclesiastical district annexed to it of
7,741 acres, with 3,681 inhabitants.&nbsp; This population has since
increased to 6,500, to meet which growth pleasing and substantial schools
have been built, at a total outlay of &pound;750, on the Viney Hill and in
the Blakeney Valley, the former opened in 1850, and the latter in
1851.&nbsp; Divine service is held in each of them under episcopal
licence.&nbsp; The three schools are attended by 200 children daily.&nbsp;
The Sunday congregations comprise 150 people in the morning, and 400 in the
afternoon.&nbsp; About fifty come to the Lord&rsquo;s Table.&nbsp; The
yearly average of christenings is forty-six, of weddings twenty-six, and of
funerals forty-five.&nbsp; The following is a list of</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Incumbents</i>.&mdash;Henry Poole; J. J. Ebsworth, M.A.</p>
<p><i>Curates</i>.&mdash;David Jones, M.A., Oxon.; --- Dixon, B.A., Oxon.;

</a></p>
<p>The next effort made to meet the spiritual wants of the increasing
population of the Forest was commenced by Edward Protheroe, Esq., M.P., who
erected and opened, July 1, 1840, &ldquo;on Cinderford Tump, where the old
holly grew,&rdquo; large and substantial school-buildings, for the benefit
of the families connected with his adjacent collieries, and consigned them
to the care of Mr. Zachariah Jolly as their master, an office which he ably
filled for several years.&nbsp; The attendance was large, <!-- page
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>sometimes
exceeding 280 children of both sexes.&nbsp; In the first seventeen years,
to July, 1857, nearly 1,400 young persons were admitted into the schools,
at ages ranging from four to twenty-two years.&nbsp; There was also an
evening school for adults, some winters numbering ninety, patronized by the
South Wales Railway Company, who subscribed liberally to it.&nbsp; By the
Act of July, 1842, dividing the Forest into ecclesiastical districts, its
south-east section was constituted one of them, and a stipend of &pound;150
per annum provided for the minister, so soon as the church intended for it
should be built and consecrated.&nbsp; Aided by large donations from the
Crown, Charles Bathurst, Esq., the Rev. Dr. Warneford, and others, the new
church, erected on the hill above Cinderford Bridge, at a cost of
&pound;3,109, in the Early Pointed style of Gothic architecture, on the
plan of a Latin cross, with a belfry turret, and capable of seating 800
persons, was consecrated under the name of St. John the Apostle, by Bishop
Monk, on the 22nd of October, 1844.&nbsp; There was a large attendance of
clergy, and upwards of 1,100 persons were present, many others being unable
to obtain admission into the church.&nbsp; The Rev. R. Davies preached from
St. Matt. xii. 34.&nbsp; The Rev. T. G. Smythies, who had been residing for
some time in the district, became the first incumbent.&nbsp; This
appointment he continues to hold, and by the aid of the Crown, the late
Bishop Monk, Dr. Warneford, and the Gally Knight Fund, has built an
excellent parsonage conveniently adjoining the church.</p>
<p>Following the course of ecclesiastical and educational progress in the
Forest, it only remains to record the most recent step taken, namely, that
at Lydbrook.&nbsp; The erection of a church there, although contemplated
for several years previously, was deferred for some time, until the
assiduous exertions of the Rev. J. Burdon, and the munificent donation of
&pound;2,000 from Mr. Machen and his relatives, secured its accomplishment.

site, which lies on the <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span

to the original school-room, was &pound;3,500, to which the following

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p173.jpg">
<img alt="Lydbrook Church and Schools" src="images/p173.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The church was designed by H. Woodyer, Esq., in the Geometrical style of
Decorated architecture, and <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>comprises a nave and aisles 60 feet long and
50 feet in width, a handsome chancel, a south porch, and tower 80 feet
high.&nbsp; It is built in the ornamented parts and internally of Bath
stone, the exterior being the gritstone of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
foundation stone was laid on Monday, the 12th of August, 1850, and the
church, called that of &ldquo;The Holy Jesus,&rdquo; was consecrated on the
4th December, 1851, by Dr. Ollivant, Bishop of Llandaff, the Bishop of the
diocese being too unwell to attend.&nbsp; Considering the season of the
year, the day was very fine, nearly fifty clergymen were present, and
upwards of one thousand people crowded into the edifice.&nbsp; The Rev. E.
Machen, Rector of Mitcheldean, preached the sermon on Isaiah lvi. 7.&nbsp;
A stipend of about &pound;120 was secured to the incumbent of the church by
annexing to it &pound;30 from the tithes of English Bicknor, with an
additional &pound;90 from the Crown, which consequently presents to the
living, alternately with Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford.&nbsp; The first
incumbent was the Rev. W. Deering, who was succeeded in 1853 by the Rev. T.
H. Chase, by whom it is still held, and who has been enabled to erect a
suitable parsonage house.&nbsp; About thirty baptisms, fifteen funerals,
with a proportionate number of weddings, take place at this church
annually.&nbsp; Nearly 150 persons attend on the Sunday morning, and 250 in
the afternoon, amongst whom there are forty communicants, the total
population of the parish being 2,500.</p>
<p>In addition to the five churches named above, my knowledge of the
district enables me to state that the rapid increase of population calls
for the erection of at least three more, on the east, south, and west sides
of the Forest, all of which should, if possible, be provided without
delay.</p>
<p>Besides the efforts of the Church, directed as now described, for the
benefit of the population of the Forest, its inhabitants have of late years
become an object of religious regard to the different bodies of
Congregationalists, most of whom are represented amongst the
Foresters.&nbsp; The wealthier coal and iron masters manifest a benevolent
interest in the welfare of their workmen, and in <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>one instance have
established a large day-school, and built a place of worship for their
use.&nbsp; The Commissioners of the Crown have always attended to
applications for help in furtherance of these objects, and have at
different times granted sums to the amount of &pound;10,347 towards
endowing the Forest churches, and in some years have devoted as much as
&pound;800 to the maintenance of schools, which they annually aid by the
following donations:</p>

176</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p class="headingsummary">The history of the Abbey of Flaxley, or St. Mary
de Dene&mdash;Its foundation by Roger Earl of Hereford in
1140&mdash;Confirmed and enriched by Henry II. and III., and Richard
II.&mdash;Suppressed in 1541&mdash;Existing remains&mdash;St.
Anthony&rsquo;s Well&mdash;The Abbey, &amp;c., granted to Sir W.
Kingston&mdash;His descendants&mdash;Mrs. C. Riches (Boevey), supposed to
be Sir R. de Coverley&rsquo;s &ldquo;perverse widow;&rdquo; her benevolent
life, and death in 1726&mdash;Nature and cessation of the Flaxley
iron-works&mdash;Erection of the present church in 1856.</p>
<p>The link which connects the Abbey of Flaxley with the Forest of Dean is
chiefly of an antiquarian nature; for instead of being included as formerly
within the limits of the Forest, it is merely approached on one side by a
promontory of Crown land, called &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
incident which led to the foundation of the abbey, as related by Leland,
who visited it a short time before it was suppressed, shows the Forest
character of its precincts.&nbsp; He tells us&mdash;&ldquo;ther was a
brother of Rogerus Earl of Hereforde that was kylled wythe an arowe in
huntinge in the very place where the abbay syns was made.&nbsp; There was a
table of the matter hanggid up in the abbay church.&rdquo;&nbsp; The date
of its institution is assigned to the year 1140, or the reign of Stephen,
its chief founder being the aforesaid Roger, aided by a Bishop of Hereford
&ldquo;that holped much to the buildinge,&rdquo; and who was probably
Robert de Betune, by whom the north-west transept of that cathedral is said
to have been erected.&nbsp; They designated it &ldquo;the Abbey of St. Mary
de Dene, or Dene Abbey,&rdquo; and devoted it to the use of the White Monks
of the Cistertian order.&nbsp; Tintern, the other abbey of that order,
established near the western border of the Forest, was founded nine years
before.&nbsp; The dress of the monks was a white cassock, <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>with a
narrow scapulary; and from this doubtless comes the name of &ldquo;St.
White&rsquo;s,&rdquo; on Little Dean Hill, in the parish of Flaxley, as
well as of another spot called Whitecross.</p>
<p>The institution of the abbey was confirmed, and its endowment augmented,
by two charters, granted by Henry II., to the following
purport:&mdash;&ldquo;Know ye that I have granted and confirmed to God and
St. Mary, and to the monks of the Cistertian order, a certain place in the
valley of Castiard called Flaxley, to build an abbey there; and all that
land called Wastdean, and one iron forge free and quit, and with as free
liberty to work as any of my forges in demesne; and all the land under the
Old Castle of Dene, with liberty to plough it up, to wit 100 acres, which
remains to be assarted, and that which is already assarted; and a certain
fishery at Redley called Newerre, and a meadow of Reidley called Pulmeade,
containing four acres; and all easements in the Forest of Dean, to wit,
common of pasture for their young cattle and hogs and for all other beasts,
and wood and timber to repair their houses and buildings, and for other
necessaries, without committing waste in the Forest; and I have given them
tithes of chesnuts out of the same Forest, and all my demesnes at Dymmock;
and five yard lands and a half, besides the demesnes and half my wood at
Dymmock, and half my nets which I have in my hands, for the conveniences of
my men, because I would have my monks enjoy that part of the wood peaceably
and quietly, without any interfering with any other persons; and I
straightly command that no person offer to disturb them upon this account;
and the lands belonging to Walfric; but so that if Uhred the clerk
continues in the abbey with the lands he exchanged, to wit, two yard lands,
that then he shall give no account of it to any body but the abbot; and all
the land of Jeoffry, son of the aforesaid Walfric, which the Earl of
Hereford did release, and all the land which Leffric de Staura gave to them
in alms, and the farm which I gave them at Wallemere, out of <!-- page
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>my new
ploughed ground containing 200 acres with the meadows and pastures, and all
other easements; and four acres of Northwood.&nbsp; I further give to them
my new ploughed grounds under Castiard, called Vincent Lands;&rdquo; added
to which, there was a grant of two oaks out of the Forest every seven days,
for supplying their iron-forge with fuel.</p>
<p>Few of the properties here named can now be traced.&nbsp; Castiard is
unknown, but perhaps the &ldquo;old Castle of Dene&rdquo; is identical with
a circular ditch and bank, about fifty yards in diameter, on Camp Hill,
between Flaxley and Little Dean.&nbsp; It may also be observed that the
present Chesnuts Enclosure is probably the site of the chesnut groves
referred to in the above grants.&nbsp; A century later (42 Henry III.) the
two oaks weekly were commuted for a tract of woodland in the Forest,
containing 872 acres, reserving, however, the herbage for the King&rsquo;s
deer and wild beasts, and all mines and quarries, and a power to the
grantee to enclose one-tenth part thereof, and to hold the same enclosed
against all animals except the King&rsquo;s deer and wild beasts, leaving
nine tenth parts always open; all which peculiarities of tenure are
connected with a tract of land yet identified by the name of &ldquo;the
Abbot&rsquo;s Woods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Between the years 1206 and 1215 King John
paid several visits to Flaxley.&nbsp; In the terms of a Papal taxation
levied in 1291 by Pope Nicholas, the property of this abbey was thus
valued:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ere long it acquired the dignity of a mitred abbey, though never of a
peeral one, its abbot being summoned to Parliament 21st Edward III.&nbsp;
During the reign of Richard II. these additional grants were made to
it:&mdash;&ldquo;Certain tenements in Leye, Bosteley, and Rodley; the manor
and impropriate church of Flaxley; the manors <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>of Blaisdon, Newnham,
and Ruerdean; distinct manors in the parishes of Dean Parva, Dymock, and
Arlingham, with a house in Abbenhall.&rdquo;&nbsp; A document in the
Chapter-house at Westminster, dated 10th Edward II., has the abbot&rsquo;s
seal attached, representing an abbot standing erect with his crosier under
a canopy slightly ornamented, with the legend <span class="smcap">s .
abbatis . de . flaxle</span>.&nbsp; The counter seal is a hand with a
crosier, and other ornaments, viz., a fleur-de-lis, &amp;c., surrounded by
the words <span class="smcap">contra sigillum abbatis de

<p>The last of these, Thomas Ware, survived the suppression of the house
and the dispersion of its brethren, of whom there were nine at that time,
the abbey being delivered up to the King&rsquo;s Commissioners in 1541,
valued at &pound;112 13s. 1d., according to Dugdale.&nbsp; Tintern Abbey
was suppressed four years previously.&nbsp; Ware retired to Aston Rowant,
near Thame, in Oxfordshire, where he spent the rest of his life in
seclusion, and was there buried in 1546.</p>
<p>The vicissitudes of 300 years have left little of the original structure
remaining: only in 1788 the pavement of the Chapter-house was discovered at
a small depth, on the east side of the refectory, extending about 45 feet,
and 24 wide.&nbsp; At the upper end a circular stone bench was exposed, and
in the centre the carved base of a pillar.&nbsp; Several coffin-lids of
stone were likewise found, sculptured with ornamented crosses, and upon one
a hand and arm holding a crosier, under which probably one of the abbots
was interred.&nbsp; The view of the abbey as it appeared about the year
1712, according to Sir R. Atkyns&rsquo;s print, exhibits traces of the
ancient residence of the abbot and monks, respecting which the Rev. T.
Rudge remarks&mdash;&ldquo;It was low, but long in front, being 60 feet in
length, 25 feet wide, and only 14 <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>high; the whole
arched with stone, and the vault intersected with plain and massy ribs, and
seems to have formed the refectory.&nbsp; The first floor contained a long
gallery, and at the south end one very spacious apartment which was
supposed to have been the abbot&rsquo;s chief room.&nbsp; The dormitories
or cells were connected with the great gallery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A further trace of the same period is also to be found at the head of
one of the brooks feeding the stream which descends the Flaxley valley,
called &ldquo;St. Anthony&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; and which, from its supposed
medicinal properties, was until late years widely famed for curing
cutaneous disorders, although under circumstances somewhat connected with
the marvellous, its peculiar efficacy being combined with the rising of the
sun, the month of May, and the visits to it being repeated nine times in
<!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>succession.&nbsp; However, after due allowance for some
exaggeration, there remains ample proof of the utility of its waters in
removing diseases of the skin.&nbsp; The square basin or reservoir of stone
immediately adjoining the head of the spring was made at the commencement
of this century for the convenience of bathers, and occupies a very
secluded position, overshadowed by a large beech-tree, and closed round
with mossy banks.&nbsp; The water is abundant in quantity, and contains
iron and lime, derived from the strata through which it percolates.&nbsp;
The general temperature is 50&deg;.</p>

<p>On the suppression of the Abbey in 1541, Henry VIII. granted it to Sir
William Kingston, the Constable of the Tower of London, memorable as being
the person to whom the dying Wolsey confessed&mdash;&ldquo;If I had served
God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have given me over
in my gray hayres.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir William dying in 1545, letters patent
regranted to Anthony his son (who in consideration of his father&rsquo;s
services was knighted on the occasion) &ldquo;the site of the late Abbey,
and all the church, bellhouse, and churchyard <!-- page 183--><a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of the same, and all
the houses, granges, &amp;c., as well within as without the said site, and
also all other the manors and granges of Flaxley, Howle, Goderith,
Climperwell, Wolmore, Blaisdon, Aclingham, Le Rouhen, Ruardene, Newland,
Dene Parva, Newnham, Pulton, and Dymock, with their rights in the county of
Gloucester, and the house and manor of Rochilburgh in the county of
Somerset, belonging to the same; and all advocations, presentations,
&amp;c., of the said parishes at any time appurtenant to the said
monastery,&rdquo; subject to the yearly payment of &pound;1 8s. 2d.&nbsp;
In the third year of Edward VI. he accompanied Lord Russell as Provost
Marshal of the army sent against the Western rebels, in which capacity his
great severity obtained for him the epithet from Fuller of &ldquo;the
terrible Provost Marshal.&rdquo;&nbsp; His name occurs on the roll of High
Sheriffs for the county in the year 1549.&nbsp; In 1555 Queen Mary
appointed him one of the commissioners to see execution done upon that
excellent prelate and martyr Bishop Hooper, by whom he had been formerly
admonished for gross immorality, and forced to submit and do penance, as
well as pay a fine of &pound;500.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to find him a vigorous opponent in parliament of
the Queen&rsquo;s effort for restoring to the religious establishments the
property of which they had been deprived.&nbsp; So strongly was he opposed
to this, that on one occasion he seized the keys of the House from the
serjeant, for which he was committed to the Tower, although upon his humble
submission he was afterwards discharged.&nbsp; The next year he was
supposed, and not without reason, to be involved in a plot to rob the
Exchequer of &pound;50,000, and therewith to raise a rebellion; but it was
discovered, and all the conspirators were executed except Sir A. Kingston,
who perhaps only escaped by dying on his road to London, whither he was
summoned to appear before the Council.&nbsp; By his will, dated 27th of
April, 1 Edw. VI., he entailed his several manors and estates on his sons,
Anthony and Edmund.&nbsp; Anthony died without issue, having in 1591 leased
the Grange estate to one <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>William Brain and others of Little Dean, for
370 years, of which an annual acknowledgment of &pound;6 continues to be
paid by its present holders, and Edmund succeeded to all the Kingston
property.&nbsp; He left two sons, Anthony and George, the former of whom
died in 1594, leaving by his will his sons Edmund and George joint
executors and heirs.&nbsp; George died in the year 1647, intestate, seized
of the Collect (Gawlet?) woods, in the parish of Flaxley, and was father of
Anthony.</p>
<p>It is said by Sir R. Atkyns that there was a monument to George Kingston
in the chancel of the original church of the parish, inscribed as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Mar. 4, 1644.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vixi dum vellem, moriebar tempore grato<br />
Et sic vita mihi mors quoque grata fuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kings have stones on them when they die,<br />
And here Kingstone under a stone doth lie;<br />
Nor Prince, nor Peer, nor any mortal wight,<br />
Can shun Death&rsquo;s dart&mdash;Death still will have his right.<br />
O then bethink to what you all must trust,<br />
At last to die, and come to judgment just.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no traces of any such monument now, and it was therefore
probably destroyed when the church was rebuilt about 1730.</p>
<p>The Kingstons took no part apparently in the contests which occurred in
the neighbourhood between the Royalists and Parliamentarians, but confined
their attention to their own affairs and the management of their
iron-works.&nbsp; The only member of the family who suffered was a Sir
Francis Crawley, who, about the year 1642&ndash;3, was deposed for a
judgment in favour of the King on the question of ship-money, or something
of a similar kind.&nbsp; The family possess one of King Charles&rsquo;s
rings as a memento of such a decision.&nbsp; Edmund died in 1621, and was
father of William, who, pursuant to his father Edmund&rsquo;s will, made a
settlement between himself, William, and James Boevey on one part, and
William Jones, of Nass, on the other.&nbsp; He left an only son, Anthony,
who, having no issue, disposed of the estate to Abraham Clarke, Esq., who
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>died here in 1683, as also his wife Joana, from whose son
Abraham, dying in 1682, it passed, in virtue of certain complex devises, to
a near relative, William Boevey, Esq.&nbsp; Mr. Boevey married Catharina
(in her sixteenth year), daughter of John Riches, Esq., an affluent London
merchant.&nbsp; She was left at the age of twenty-two a widow, which she
inexorably remained until her death, on the 3rd January, 1726, in her
fifty-seventh year, leaving a name for benevolence and ability which the
neighbourhood venerates to this day.&nbsp; Dr. Geo. Hickes calls her, in
the preface to his &lsquo;Thesaurus,&rsquo; published in 1702&ndash;3,
&ldquo;pr&aelig;stantissima et honestissima matrona Catharine Bovey,&rdquo;
and was most probably one of her personal friends, agreeably to a
traditionary account in the family, that &ldquo;she was very friendly to
the nonjuring clergy, and that she had frequently received and protected
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are several pictures of clergymen at Flaxley, which have always
been believed to be portraits of Mrs. Boevey&rsquo;s nonjuring
friends.&nbsp; Amongst these are two in episcopal habits, one of which is
ascertained to be the portrait of the deprived Dr. Frampton, Bishop of
Gloucester, since an exactly similar painting exists in the Palace at
Gloucester.&nbsp; Flaxley is mentioned as her residence by Sir R. Atkyns in
1712, where, he tells us, &ldquo;she hath an handsome house and pleasant
gardens, and a great estate, a furnace for casting of iron, and three
forges,&rdquo; as also appears by Kip&rsquo;s view of it.&nbsp; In 1714
Steele dedicated to her the second volume of &lsquo;The Ladies&rsquo;
Library,&rsquo; the frontispiece to which Mr. Kerslake describes as
&ldquo;representing a young lady, dressed in widow&rsquo;s weeds, opening a
book upon a table, on which also lies a skull; her admirers, in long wigs
and swords, are thronging round the door.&rdquo;&nbsp; In one of his
letters to Lady Steele, dated the 17th January, 1717, he
writes&mdash;&ldquo;I have yours in a leaf of the
widow&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such incidents seem to prove that this
highly-gifted lady was the original of the character so graphically
delineated by Steele in his description of &ldquo;the perverse
widow.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>numbers of the &lsquo;Spectator&rsquo; in
which she is introduced generally bear his name, and she probably was more
intimate with him than with Addison (although both are said to have visited
the Abbey), since he would naturally pass near Flaxley whenever he
travelled between London and his house at Llangunnor, near
Caermarthen.&nbsp; Nothing less than such a familiar acquaintance could
have enabled him to give so exact and real a description of her as occurs
in No. 113.</p>
<p>In Ballard&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ladies,&rsquo; first printed in 1752, and on
her monument in Westminster Abbey and in Flaxley Church, her more public
virtues are displayed; but the value of her home life, which many of the
poor Foresters had experienced in her bounties, is best related in the
words of her faithful attendant, Mrs. Rachel Vergo, &ldquo;who always
waited particularly on her mistress, and was the only servant who sat up,
as she spent an hour or two every night in her closet.&nbsp; She did the
same in the morning, and was a very early riser.&nbsp; Mrs. Vergo had the
care of the family under Mrs. Mary Pope, a relation of Mrs. Bovey, who came
for a visit of a month, and stayed nearly forty years.&nbsp; The regularity
and economy in the family was great.&nbsp; The maids were kept to work till
eight o&rsquo;clock at night, and the rest was their own time.&nbsp; Mrs.
Bovey frequently called for her charity account book to see if it kept pace
with her expenses in dress, which was always very handsome.&nbsp; Mrs.
Vergo was often sent to Ross and Mitcheldean to buy materials to make
garments for the poor.&nbsp; The old table-linen and sheets were made into
childbed linen, which, together with shirts and shifts of all sizes, were
kept in a closet.&nbsp; It was Mrs. Vergo&rsquo;s business to give them out
as her lady ordered.&nbsp; Two ladies came to visit Mrs. Pope at the time
the epidemic fever raged in Gloucestershire in 1719.&nbsp; One of them,
Mrs. Cowling, died of it at the Abbey.&nbsp; The other, Mrs. Grace Butler,
agreed with Mrs. Bovey and Mrs. Pope all to lie in the same vault with the
deceased.&nbsp; The vault was built accordingly in Flaxley
churchyard.&nbsp; Mrs. Bovey died first at the Abbey, and was laid by <!--
page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>her
friend.&nbsp; Mrs. Pope was brought from Twickenham in Surrey, and Mrs.
Grace Butler twenty years afterwards from Worminghurst in Sussex.&nbsp;
Every afternoon during her lady&rsquo;s life Mrs. Vergo was ordered to wear
a silk gown.&nbsp; Six of the poor children who were kept at school at
Flaxley dined by turns regularly every Sunday at the Abbey, when Mrs. Bovey
heard them say their Catechism.&nbsp; She was very often in the habit of
lending money to poor clergymen, which was frequently repaid to her in
small sums, but more often given to them.&nbsp; She did the same, too, by
other distressed people whom she believed to be honest and
industrious.&nbsp; During the Christmas holidays before Mrs. Bovey died she
had the thirty children who were taught at her expense, to dine at the
Abbey upon beef and pudding.&nbsp; Mrs. Vergo sat at the head of the table,
and two of the housemaids waited upon them.&nbsp; After dinner Mrs. Bovey
had them all into the parlour, where she was sitting dressed in white and
silver.&nbsp; She showed them her clothes and her jewels, talked pleasantly
and with great good nature to them, and having given to each of them
sixpence she dismissed them.&nbsp; When they left her they had a harp and
fiddle playing in the great hall, where they danced two hours and went away
in good time.&nbsp; When Mrs. Bovey was dressing before dinner she said to
Mrs. Vergo, &lsquo;Rachel, you will be surprised that I put such fine
clothes on to-day; but I think that these poor children will remember me
the longer for it.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was then to all appearance very well,
but she died that very day month of a bowel
complaint.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Upon Wednesday morning,&rdquo; wrote Mr.
MacBarrow, &ldquo;she was as well at breakfast as usual; between eleven and
twelve she was seized with a most violent colic.&nbsp; We sent to
Gloucester for Greville, as the nearest at hand; that night for Lane, but
he was not to be met with.&nbsp; The extremity of pain continued, and,
notwithstanding all means that could be used, nothing would pass.&nbsp; She
apprehended death approaching the first day, and said what her illness was:
we sent to Oxford and <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Hereford, but no physician until it was too
late.&nbsp; Upon Friday morning she had a little ease, which gave us great
hopes; but very soon the exquisite pain returned, and never left her until
death had performed its great office, betwixt eleven and twelve on Saturday
morning.&nbsp; She was sensible all along, and expressed great satisfaction
in being here, where she said she always wished to die.&nbsp; She was
buried in the same vault with Mrs. Cowling on 23rd January,
1726.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Of her personal beauty,&rdquo; observes the Rev.
C. Crawley, &ldquo;although highly extolled, it really appears that very
little can be said or seen, if we may form our opinions from the three
portraits of her at Flaxley Abbey.&nbsp; They all represent a broad surface
of a benevolent and good-natured countenance; and though they were
evidently painted at different periods of her life, yet they bear so great
a resemblance to each other that we may reasonably infer they were all good
likenesses&mdash;in each of them the mole on the cheek has been defined
with all due minuteness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Boevey bequeathed &pound;1200 to augment the living of Flaxley, the
interest of &pound;400 to apprentice poor children, and a similar sum
towards putting them out.&nbsp; Lastly she designed the rebuilding of the
church, &ldquo;which pious design was speedily executed by Mrs. Mary
Pope.&rdquo;&nbsp; This work was effected about the year 1730, but report
says <i>not</i> &ldquo;speedily,&rdquo; as the parishioners found it
necessary to institute a suit in Chancery to secure its
accomplishment.&nbsp; The site of the old chapel was retained, only the
size was increased, if we may judge from the view that Sir R. Atkyns gives
of the former building, which he says was &ldquo;very small, and had a low
wooden tower at the west end.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of the old monuments were
transferred to it, and the new church, although rather plain, was
&ldquo;peculiarly neat&rdquo; and substantial.&nbsp; Upon Mrs.
Boevey&rsquo;s death the estate passed by will to Thomas Crawley, Esq., of
London, merchant, in tail male, upon the condition of adding the name of
Boevey to Crawley.&nbsp; Thomas, a lineal descendant, succeeded to the
baronetage on the death of Sir Charles Barrow in <!-- page 189--><a

<p>&ldquo;The iron manufactory,&rdquo; writes Rev. T. Rudge, at the
beginning of this century, &ldquo;is still carried on, and the metal is
esteemed peculiarly good; but its goodness does not arise from any
extraordinary qualities in the ore, but from the practice of working the
furnace and forges with charcoal wood, without any mixture of pit
coal.&nbsp; The quantity of charcoal required is so considerable, that the
furnace cannot be kept in blow or working more than nine months
successively, the wheels which work the bellows and hammers being turned by
a powerful stream of water.&nbsp; At this time (Oct. 28, 1802) a cessation
has taken place for nearly a year.&nbsp; Lancashire ore, which is brought
to Newnham by sea, furnishes the principal supply; the mine found in the
Forest being either too scanty to answer the expense of raising it, or when
raised too difficult of fusion, and consequently too consumptive of fuel,
to allow the common use of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since then so great a <!-- page
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>change has
been effected in the mode of reducing the ore, that several tons of the
Lancashire mine yet remain unused near the spot where the Flaxley furnace
stood, the Forest ore readily yielding to the treatment it now receives in
the blast furnaces of the district.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the furnace is at
work, about twenty tons a week are reduced to pig iron; in this state it is
carried to the forges, where about eight tons a week are hammered out into
bars, ploughshares, &amp;c., ready for the smith.&rdquo;&nbsp; The aged
people of the neighbourhood well remember when the Flaxley furnaces were
<!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>in
blast, and tell of the ancient cinders and pickings of the old mine-holes
being taken down to them.&nbsp; With their disuse the former mode of
manufacturing iron ceased in the district.&nbsp; The furnace buildings have
been long removed, and the pools drained in which the water accumulated for
driving the machinery.</p>

<p>Thus the &ldquo;Castiard Vale&rdquo; is once more devoted wholly to the
picturesque, with the most pleasing effect, its beauty being yet further
enhanced by a well-placed and exquisitely designed church, erected a few
yards to the west of the one built by Mrs. Pope, after the designs of G. G.
Scott, Esq., in the Early Decorated style of pointed architecture. <a
name="citation191"></a><a href="#footnote191"
class="citation">[191]</a>&nbsp; It comprises a richly ornamented chancel,
nave, and north aisle, and a tower surmounted with a broach spire.&nbsp;
There is churchroom for about 300 of the poor Foresters dwelling on
Pope&rsquo;s Hill, as well as for the inhabitants of the parish.&nbsp; It
was consecrated on the 18th of September, 1856, by Dr. Baring, Bishop of
Gloucester and Bristol, who preached on the occasion from Eccl. v. 1, most
of the surrounding gentry attending, and fifty of the clergy.&nbsp; The
present school-room was built in 1840, and accommodates sixty scholars.</p>

<p class="headingsummary">The Forest roads and railways&mdash;Vestiges of
some very ancient roads, apparently Roman&mdash;The old &ldquo;crooked,
winding, and cross ways,&rdquo; when no wheeled vehicles were allowed in
the Forest&mdash;The original road across the Forest from Gloucester to
Monmouth&mdash;Roads, first improvement in 1761&mdash;Road Act of 1795
carried into effect&mdash;Mitcheldean a post town&mdash;Roads further
improved in 1828 and 1841&mdash;their present state and extent&mdash;The
tramroads and railways of the Forest.</p>
<p>Unusually perfect remains of very ancient roads still exist in various
parts of the Forest, resembling those made by the Romans, being slightly
raised above the general level of the ground, and carefully pitched with
large block stones, not unfrequently a foot square.&nbsp; The most
remarkable of these is found along the vale below Puttern Edge, and called
&ldquo;Dean&rsquo;s Road,&rdquo; where the pitching remains in many places,
being about eight feet in width.&nbsp; Although no coins have been found
near it, yet its direction, indicating a connexion between the old
iron-works above Sowdley, and the neighbourhood of Lydney, suggests that it
was used in ancient times when the minerals of the district were carried
from place to place on packhorses.&nbsp; Another road, yet traceable, gives
the name of &ldquo;Kymin&rdquo; (Chemin) to a hill opposite Monmouth, the
slopes of which it ascends in the direction of the Forest; and a third is
partially preserved in a lane leading amongst the cottages at Little
Dean&rsquo;s Woodside: it is called by the inhabitants &ldquo;the
Causeway,&rdquo; being yet partly paved, and uniting with another road,
which is still in places formed of large stones.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;crooked, winding, and cross-ways,&rdquo; which are said by
Camden to have existed in the Forest, and to <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>have rendered it a
place of refuge for noble fugitives, were those paths which penetrated its
depths, having their direction turned and rendered perplexing through the
frequent interposition of streams, bogs, and thickets.&nbsp; Such were the
means of communication which for many generations served the purposes of
the Foresters, who permitted no wheeled vehicles to enter their domain, and
possessed few if any themselves.</p>
<p>One high road, nearly identical with the present line between Monmouth
and Mitcheldean, seems to have sufficed for the neighbourhood during at
least 200 years.&nbsp; It was in use in the age of Elizabeth, a silver
penny of that reign having been found on it, between Nailbridge and Harrow
Hill.&nbsp; By this road Lord Herbert must have marched his army of 500
horse and 1500 foot towards Gloucester in 1643, as likewise Sir W. Waller a
month later when pursued by Prince Maurice, and most probably Colonel
Massey took the same route more than once.&nbsp; It seems also to be
alluded to in the following suggestion made to Sir R. Atkyns, as Lord Chief
Baron of the Exchequer, by a committee appointed in 1692 to inquire into
the state of the Forest, with the view of securing its better government
and preservation.&nbsp; They proposed that &ldquo;a Justice-seat should be
held once a year, for six or seven years, during the long vacation, within
the said Forest, or not very remote from it, which might be done by
deputation from the Lord Chief Justice in Eyre to some of their
Majesties&rsquo; Justices of Assize going in their <i>ordinary circuits
from Gloucester to Monmouth</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their journey was of course
made on horseback, the usage being still continued, which the father of the
Lord Chancellor Clarendon permitted him to adopt, when he gave him
&ldquo;leave to ride the circuit in the summer with his uncle the Chief
Justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; An old house at the foot of the Plump Hill, near
Mitcheldean, called &ldquo;the Judges&rsquo; Lodgings,&rdquo; because they
made it their resting-place as they passed that way, seems confirmatory of
the above suggestion.</p>
<p>The first mention of any sum being spent on the <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>improvement of the
Forest roads, occurs about the time that the trees planted in 1668 would be
growing into timber fit for the Royal dockyards, and requiring therefore
facilities for removal to the water-side.&nbsp; Hence, between 1761 and
1786, upwards of &pound;11,305 1s. 10d. was laid out on them.&nbsp; Mr.
Thomas Blunt, the Deputy Surveyor of the Forest, stated in 1788, in
explanation of such an outlay, &ldquo;That there are two great roads
leading across the Forest, which have been made and kept in repair by the
produce of timber felled and sold for that purpose, and on which by far the
greater part of the expense for roads has been bestowed; the one enters the
Forest at Mitcheldean, and proceeds quite across the Forest to Coleford,
the other leads from Little Dean to Coleford.&nbsp; These two roads have
been made chiefly with a view to the convenience of the public, being the
principal roads from Gloucester to South Wales; neither of which roads, nor
others which have been made and amended at a considerable expense to the
Crown, are any way conducive to the preservation of the Forest, as they are
but of little use in the conveyance of timber felled for the use of the
Navy, the Navy timber in general being carried by a distinct road leading
from the Forest towards Blakeney, which induces him to believe that the
roads lately made are disadvantageous to the Forest, more carts and waggons
having been used since the making of the roads in the fetching and carrying
away of coal, greater quantities of timber being used in the coalworks, and
much more timber secretly conveyed away under the coal than heretofore;
which practice he believes might in a great measure be prevented by the
erecting of turnpike gates on the roads, the tolls whereof would be fully
sufficient to keep the roads in necessary repair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Forest roads were still in so execrable a condition, being
impassable in the winter, and at other times perilous to the heavily laden
coal waggons and horses, always requiring large teams, according to the
unanimous testimony of the oldest residents, that a <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>further outlay on
them, to the amount of &pound;10,645, took place in carrying out the
provisions of the Act passed in 1795 &ldquo;for amending, widening,
improving, and keeping in repair several roads in and through His
Majesty&rsquo;s Forest of Dean, and the waste lands thereto belonging, in
the county of Gloucester, and for turning, altering, and changing the
course of the said roads, and for making several new roads in the said
Forest to lead to certain places in and near the same; and also for
amending, widening, and keeping in repair certain roads leading from the
said Forest to and through several parts of the parish of Newland adjoining
the Forest, in the said county of Gloucester.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Surveyor
Brimner states, that at a meeting of the Verderers of the Forest, and the
Roads Trustees, held at Newnham, 22nd April, 1796, the following roads were
appointed to be put in repair:&mdash;</p>
<p>From Mitcheldean to Coleford Lane End.<br />
&bdquo;&nbsp; St. White&rsquo;s&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; &bdquo;<br />
&bdquo;&nbsp; Coleford&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; Viney Hill.<br />
&bdquo;&nbsp; Viney Hill&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; Purton Passage.<br />
&bdquo;&nbsp; Miry Stock&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; Lydbrook.<br />
&bdquo;&nbsp; Perry Grove&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; Clearwell.<br />
&bdquo;&nbsp; The Bearse&nbsp; &bdquo;&nbsp; Bream.</p>
<p>At this time, therefore, so much of the ancient road as lay between
Mitcheldean and Nail Bridge was discarded for the present one, which
ascends the Stenders Hill by a more even slope, and avoids the abrupt rise
of Harrow Hill.&nbsp; The old line may yet be traced, and Nail Bridge
remains; in allusion to which improvements the following advertisement
appeared in <i>The Gloucester Journal</i>, Monday, Sept. 5,
1796:&mdash;&ldquo;James Graham, at the George Inn, Mitcheldean, has great
pleasure in returning his respectful thanks for the liberal support he has
received, and announces to the public that the new road through His
Majesty&rsquo;s Forest of Dean, leading from Mitcheldean to Coleford and
Monmouth, which is the high road from Gloucester to South Wales, is already
greatly improved, and in a short time will be equal to any in this part of
the country.&nbsp; It is allowed that <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>travellers will save
a mile at least by taking this way from Gloucester to Monmouth; and when
accurately measured, it is imagined that the saving will be found to be
still greater.&nbsp; Graham has laid in a stock of admirable port and other
wines, and every exertion will be made for public accommodation.&nbsp; Post
chaises at 1s. per mile, and sober drivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor was this advertisement a mere puff, as Mr. Budge, writing in the
year 1803, states&mdash;&ldquo;The great travelling road to Monmouth from
Gloucester now leads through Mitcheldean, which, with the good
accommodation afforded to travellers, will in process of time be probably
the occasion of raising it to a considerable rank among towns of this
description.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides which, there are sufficient intimations
in the double approach to the George Inn and large yard adjoining it, as
well as in the capacious stable-yards belonging to the other inns of the
town, which is beset with six toll-bars, that its character must have been
such as is here given; to which may also be added the numerous
farmers&rsquo; teams which were constantly passing through the town to and
from the collieries in the Forest, in droves of ten or fifteen together,
the bells on the horses merrily jingling as they moved along.&nbsp;
Connected with which circumstance it may be observed that the old roads of
the district abound in horsepools, or watering-places, wherever a spring
could be made available for their supply.&nbsp; At this time the two
Mitcheldean toll-bars, situated on the Gloucester and Monmouth line of
road, were let at &pound;250 per annum.&nbsp; The only link connecting in
these respects the past with recent times was supplied until the last five
years by our old friend Mr. Yearsley&rsquo;s coach, running three times a
week between Coleford and Gloucester.</p>
<p>For the next thirty years the Crown does not seem to have laid out any
money upon the Forest roads, although their condition was so bad that it
was urged as a reason for building churches and schools in the Forest,
those of the surrounding parishes not being readily accessible to the
inhabitants.&nbsp; But in 1828 and the two following <!-- page 197--><a

198</span>All these roads are now in excellent repair, but they have been,
nevertheless, compelled to yield to the superior advantages of the railway
system, here grafted, as is the case in some other places, upon the useful
but less perfect tramway. <a name="citation198"></a><a href="#footnote198"
class="citation">[198]</a></p>
<p>In the years 1809 and 1810 a local Act authorised the construction of an
extensive system of tramways throughout the Forest, under the auspices of
&ldquo;the Severn and Wye&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bullo Pill&rdquo; Companies,
traversing respectively the western and eastern sides of the
district.&nbsp; The latter of these, the tramway which descends the eastern
valley through Cinderford and Sowdley to the Severn, passed into the hands
of the South Wales Railway Company, who purchased it in 1849, with the view
of forming it into a locomotive road; and this they effected after great
difficulty, in consequence of being obliged to carry on the trade upon the
tramway at the same time, and opened it on the 14th July, 1854.&nbsp; Its
present length, extending from Bullo Pill to the Churchway Colliery, is
nearly seven miles.&nbsp; There is a branch from it of three-quarters of a
mile to the Whimsey, another of one mile and a half to the Lightmoor
Colliery, one of three-quarters of a mile to the Crump Meadow Colliery, one
of a quarter of a mile to the Nelson Colliery, and a shorter one to the
Regulator Pits.&nbsp; It is a single line, constructed throughout on the
broad-gauge principle, and for the present only conveys minerals.&nbsp; A
central line, in addition to the above, is in course of formation.&nbsp;
The tramway of &ldquo;the Severn and Wye Company,&rdquo; on the west side
of the Forest, has not been materially altered.</p>

<p class="headingsummary">The deer of the Forest, and its timber, plants,
birds, ferns, and early allusions to the Forest deer&mdash;The Court of
Swainmote, by which they were preserved&mdash;Act of 1668 regarding
them&mdash;Reports of the Chief Forester in Fee and Bowbearer, and
Verderers, in 1788, respecting the deer&mdash;Mr. Machen&rsquo;s memoranda
on the same subject&mdash;Their removal in 1849&mdash;The birds of the
Forest&mdash;Unforestlike aspect of the Forest, now, compared with its
former condition&mdash;Successive reductions of its timber&mdash;Its oldest
existing trees described&mdash;Present appearance of the young
woods&mdash;Table of the Timber Stock, from time to time, during the last
200 years&mdash;An account of the rarer plants and ferns.</p>
<p>The earliest allusion to deer in the Forest is, as might be expected,
coeval with its being constituted a royal domain.&nbsp; William the
Conqueror is said to have been hunting here when he first heard of the
taking of York by the Danes in August, 1069.&nbsp; In Henry I.&rsquo;s
reign the deer were so numerous as to make the tithes of them worthy of
being given as a royal present by that king to the Abbey of Gloucester,
which city, says Geraldus, was supplied with venison from the Forest of
Dean; and the frequent visits of King John to Flaxley Abbey and to the
Castle of St. Briavel&rsquo;s during the latter years of his reign, arose
probably from the abundant sport the neighbourhood afforded him.</p>
<p>The deer of the King&rsquo;s forests were preserved in ancient times
with the greatest care by the execution of certain laws, administered by a
Swainmote Court, which was regulated by officers called Verderers,
Foresters, and Agisters, who disposed of all cases in which deer were
killed without warrant: not that any man was to lose either life or limb,
as formerly, for so doing; but he was to be heavily fined if he had
property, or, if not, to be imprisoned a year and a day, and be then
released, <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>if he could find sufficient securities, or be abjured the
realm.&nbsp; A curious exception existed, however, in the case of any
archbishop, bishop, earl, or baron summoned to the King, and by the way
passing through a royal forest, when it was lawful for him to &ldquo;take
and kill one or two deer, by the view of the Forester, if he be present, or
else shall cause one to blow an horne for him that he seem not to steal the
deer.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the fawning season, or &ldquo;fence-month,&rdquo; as
it was called, commencing fifteen days before and ending fifteen days after
Midsummer-day, the Forest officers attended within their own walks, and
required all manner of dogs to be kept in at the peril of the owner,
bringing before the verderers any persons found hunting or out of the
highway with a bow or gun, or gathering rushes or bents, or driving swine
or cattle, to the hurt or disquiet of the deer.&nbsp; They were also
charged at all times with the preservation of the vert or underwood, on
account of the shelter and food it afforded the deer.</p>

<p>By the Act of 1668 it is provided, that, &ldquo;should His Majesty think
fit to restore the game of deer within the said Forrest, the same shall not
exceed the number <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>of 800 deer of all sorts at any one
time;&rdquo; intimating that during the Civil War, and the period of the
Commonwealth, that kingly pastime had been discontinued.&nbsp; The same Act
directs that &ldquo;the owners, tenants, &amp;c., of any of the several
lands lying within the bounds of the Forest may keep any sort of dogs
inexpediated to hunt and kill any beast of chase or other game,&rdquo;
except during &ldquo;the fence month,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the time of the
winter heyning, viz. from the 11th of November to the 23rd of April,&rdquo;
when all rights of common were to be in abeyance.</p>
<p>Charles Edwin, Esq., &ldquo;Chief Forester in Fee and Bowbearer,&rdquo;
in 1787, stated to the Commissioners that he claimed by virtue of his
office to be entitled to the right shoulder of all bucks and does killed
within the Forest, and also to ten fee bucks and ten fee does, annually to
be there killed and taken at his own free will and pleasure, with licence
to hawk, hunt, fish, and fowl within the Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; As bowbearer,
it was his duty &ldquo;to attend His Majesty with a bow and arrow, and six
men clothed in green, whenever His Majesty shall be pleased to hunt within
the said Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Edmund Probyn, Esq., one of the Verderers of
the Forest, stated at the same time, that the number of bucks and does
which it contained could not be ascertained; but it was much understocked,
so that the warrants were sometimes sent back unexecuted.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Until the deer were removed, each of the four verderers was entitled to a
buck and a doe every year.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first remember the Forest,&rdquo; Mr. Machen remarks, in
his private papers, &ldquo;now 65 years since, <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>the deer were very
numerous.&nbsp; I recollect my father taking me up to the Buckholt in an
evening for the purpose of showing them to me, and we never failed of
seeing several:&rdquo; this was about 1790.&nbsp; &ldquo;From that time for
20 years, in consequence of the decrease of the covert and the increase of
poachers, they rapidly diminished, until in 1810, when I do not believe
there were ten in the whole Forest.&nbsp; At this period the enclosures
were made for the preservation of timber, and woodmen appointed to the care
of them; the few deer that were left were protected, and as the young trees
grew up so as to afford them shelter, they rapidly increased, and in thirty
years, viz. in 1840, I should think there were not less than 800 or 1000
deer in the Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red deer were introduced in 1842 by Mr. Herring, who brought
down on 24th February, from Woburn, two stags and four hinds.&nbsp; They
were in fine condition, and were turned loose in Russell&rsquo;s Enclosure,
one mile from the Speech-house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Machen further notes as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;October, 1842.&mdash;Two of the hinds have calves with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October 20th.&mdash;One of the stags was hunted from
Trippenkennet, in Herefordshire, and swam the Wye three times: the hounds
brought him into Nag&rsquo;s Head Enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;July, 1844.&mdash;Two stags, three hinds, and a calf are now in
Park Hill Enclosure, and are frequently seen in the meadow in front of
Whitemead.&nbsp; One old stag is at Edge Hills.&nbsp; A hind is sometimes
seen in the Highmeadow Woods, and it is known that one was killed
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October.&mdash;A young hind was sent down, and turned out in
Haywood Enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October, 1845.&mdash;The two old stags are wandering about, and
seldom in the Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October 4.&mdash;Hunted the stag near Park End; ran four hours,
but lost him, night coming on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;September 20th, 1846.&mdash;The stag that was about <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>Staunton and
Newland was killed this day, after a run of three hours.&nbsp; He was found
on the old hills near Newland, and killed in Coleford.&nbsp; This was a
four years old deer, calved in the Forest; the hind and calf went to
Staunton, and never returned: the hind was killed by poachers.&nbsp; The
venison of the stag was excellent: the haunches were 45 lbs.
each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October, 1847.&mdash;Another stag was killed after a good
run.&nbsp; Two were found, and ran some time together before the hounds in
Park Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October 6, 1848.&mdash;The last stag returned to the Forest,
after having been in the woods, &amp;c., near Chepstow almost a year.&nbsp;
He was found in Oaken Hill, and killed, after a run of three hours, in
Sallow Vallets.&nbsp; His haunches weighed 51 lbs., and the whole weight
307 lbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fallow deer of the Forest were reduced in number after the
year 1850 by killing a large number of does.&nbsp; They were all fine
animals, and when the enclosures protected them they got very fat, and the
venison of fine flavour.&nbsp; They were generally hunted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time of Lord Duncan&rsquo;s Committee in 1849 a general feeling
prevailed against the deer, on the ground of their demoralising influence
as an inducement to poaching, and all were ordered to be destroyed, there
being at that time perhaps 150 bucks and 300 does.</p>
<p>The remarks &ldquo;Going after the deer,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t, may be, want to buy some meat?&rdquo; are no doubt fresh in
the recollection of many.&nbsp; Going about with guns, in numbers too
formidable for the keepers to interfere, shooting the deer by day, and
carrying them off at night, were by no means uncommon.&nbsp; Poachers of a
poorer and more primitive stamp are said to have resorted to the expedient
of dropping a heavy iron bar from where they had secreted themselves, on
the projecting branch of an oak, so that it might fall across the neck of
the deer which had come to browse beneath.&nbsp; Or they baited a large
hook with an apple, and suspended it at a proper height by a stout cord
over a path <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>which the deer were observed to frequent.&nbsp; They also were
known to set a number of nooses of iron wire in a row, skilfully fastened
to a rope secured to a couple of trees, into which, aided by dogs, they
drove the deer.&nbsp; With such kind of sport at command, we may be well
assured of the truth of Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s statement before Lord
Duncan&rsquo;s Committee&mdash;&ldquo;if once men begin to poach, we can
never reckon upon their working afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ornamental to a
forest as deer undoubtedly are, and disappointing as it may be to the
stranger to find none in the Forest of Dean, we cannot regret that, in
1855, Mr. Machen records, &ldquo;there is not now a deer left in the
Forest, and only a few stragglers in the Highmeadow
Woods.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p>Besides deer inhabiting the Forest from the earliest times, no doubt it
was also frequented by all such animals as used to be accounted
&ldquo;beasts of the forest,&rdquo; viz. the hare, boar, and wolf, in
addition to the hart and hind.</p>
<p>Adverting to the feathered tribes which have been observed in this
neighbourhood, Mr. Machen remarks&mdash;&ldquo;The birds in the Forest do
not differ much from those met with in other parts of the west of
England.&nbsp; I have been struck with the contrast in the smaller number
of large birds, mostly of the falcon kind, which are now seen, in
comparison with those I remember fifty years ago.&nbsp; At that time you
might often observe fifteen or twenty kites and hawks hovering over Church
Hill and the Bicknor walks; but now it is not frequently the case that you
see one.&nbsp; It appears to me also that there is a great diminution in
the number of all kinds of birds, small as well as large, so that in some
parts of the Forest and woods the stillness and absence of animals of every
kind is surprising.&nbsp; Ravens too have become very scarce.&nbsp; A pair
had a nest by Simmon&rsquo;s Rock this year (1857), but they are said to
drive their young to a distance as soon as they can provide for
themselves.&nbsp; The only kind of plover in the Forest is the green plover
or lapwing, which were very numerous at one time in the <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>wet greens.&nbsp;
Woodcocks used to be thought never to breed in this country, but they
certainly do so now.&nbsp; In this Forest and in other places I have
frequently seen them during the summer, and have observed their nests, made
on the ground, of slight construction.&nbsp; One above Whitemead had only
two eggs.&nbsp; When the plantations were first made, they became, even in
the centre of them, well stocked with partridges; but as the woods grew up
they all disappeared.&nbsp; Pheasants were turned out by me at Whitemead,
and soon spread over the whole Forest.&nbsp; At one time there was a good
stock, but lately they are much reduced.&nbsp; There are a great variety of
woodpeckers, which do not, I think, hurt sound trees, but rather those
which they find already decaying.&nbsp; Fieldfares and redwings come in
great numbers.&nbsp; Nightingales are not numerous in the Forest, although
they abound in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; They do not like its depths, or
large trees hollow below; but prefer a thick close cover, and the vicinity
of a road or path where the bushes are low and thick: but I never heard one
in the middle of the Forest.&nbsp; Although a country like this seems
unsuited to the wheatear, as preferring the Downs of Sussex, &amp;c., still
they come here in the spring, and are generally seen by the roads, or on
stone walls in which they build their nests, and even in the heaps of
stones, as also in the rails of bark.&nbsp; I remember that beautiful bird,
the kingfisher, by the Forest brooks, but now you never see one.&nbsp;
Flocks of rooks sometimes come into the neighbourhood when the oaks are
much blighted, to feed on the grubs, and in such quantities that the trees
are quite black with them.&nbsp; They come from a distance, as they are not
seen at other times, and never breed in the Forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gee, speaking of the birds which he has observed on the north-east
side of the Forest, states&mdash;&ldquo;The raven is seen more frequently
in the neighbourhood than in most parts of England: his croak over head is
not at all an uncommon sound.&nbsp; A pair of buzzards will occasionally
circle aloft for a considerable time.&nbsp; The <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>snipe is found very
early on the Forest, so much so that I have known in the month of July six
killed in a day.&nbsp; The jack snipe particularly abounds about &lsquo;the
Dam Pool.&rsquo;&nbsp; The bittern has been twice shot near the same spot
within the last twenty years.&nbsp; The seagull skims over occasionally
from the Severn side.&nbsp; The water-ousel is frequently met with on the
Forest brooks.&nbsp; The cross-bill comes sometimes into the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The turtle-dove particularly abounds, so that in early
summer our woods are in a charm with their soft purring.&nbsp; The fern
owls are very numerous.&nbsp; I once came on a considerable flock of the
rare bird, the siskin.&nbsp; The titmouse tribe are abundant; but we never
see the rarer species, the bearded or the crested tit.&nbsp; The chats and
the wheatear are of course common.&nbsp; The woodpeckers are very common:
even the two pied species might be obtained here with very little
trouble.&nbsp; We are all over willow wrens in the spring.&nbsp; On the
whole, I should say that it is a neighbourhood unfavourable for the
observation of birds; and yet, were an observant naturalist to come among
us, he would soon astonish us by what he would discover.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE TIMBER.</h3>
<p>Most strangers visiting the Forest do so in the expectation of seeing
groves of stately timber covering the ground in every direction, and are
much disappointed when they find the greater part to consist of oaks,
barely fifty years old, comprised in enclosures, and the remainder of the
surface disfigured by furnaces, collieries, and groups of inferior
buildings.&nbsp; The Forest as it existed in the days of the Norman and
Plantagenet kings, William I. and John, who resorted to it for the
pleasures of the chase, when its dark recesses often concealed noble
fugitives, or disposed its population to habits of violence and plunder, or
at a still later period, when its stately trees had become objects of
apprehension or jealousy to the Spaniards, was widely different from what
it is at <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>present.&nbsp; Few of the trees of those days have survived the
fellings, spoliations, and storms of succeeding ages.&nbsp; According to
Mr. Pepys, &ldquo;a great fall&rdquo; in Edward III.&rsquo;s reign left
only those which in his time were called &ldquo;forbid trees,&rdquo; to be
further reduced by the requirements of seventy-two iron forges, which then
lit up the district, or the yet more voracious furnaces by which they were
succeeded.&nbsp; One storm alone, viz. that of the 18th of February, 1662,
prostrated in one night 1,000 oaks, and as many beech, whilst only 200
were, it is said, left standing after the wholesale fellings perpetrated by
Sir John Winter.&nbsp; Of these select few, the venerable &ldquo;Jack of
the Yat,&rdquo; near the Coleford and Mitcheldean Road on the top of
&ldquo;The Long Hill,&rdquo; appears to be one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p207.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;Jack of the Yat&rdquo;" src="images/p207.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Mr. Machen thinks it the most ancient tree in the Forest, and probably
four or five hundred years old.&nbsp; It is of the Quercus robur kind, or
old English oak, the stalks of its acorns being long, with rarely more than
one acorn on a stalk, and the stalks of its leaves short.&nbsp; A few years
back it was struck by lightning, which has left a deep groove on its
trunk.&nbsp; In 1830 it measured, at 6 feet from the ground, 17 feet
8&frac34; <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>inches; and in 1846 upwards of 18 feet 3&frac12; inches: but it
has long since passed its prime. <a name="citation208"></a><a
href="#footnote208" class="citation">[208]</a>&nbsp; Two other oaks,
similar in form, and fully as large in girth, yet exist, but in a decaying
state, on Shapridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p208.jpg">
<img alt="The &ldquo;Newland Oak.&rdquo;" src="images/p208.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There are other trees approaching in age to the above, viz. an oak in
Sallow Vallets Enclosure near the Drive, of the Quercus sessiliflora kind,
its leaves growing on long stalks, and the acorns clustering together on
short stalks, and perhaps 200 years old, being 13 feet round at 6 feet from
the ground, and still in a very flourishing condition.&nbsp; Another
oak-tree, near York Lodge, measuring 21 feet round, formed apparently of
two trees which grew together for ages, but not long since threatened to
fall asunder, necessitating their being cramped up across the head by a
transverse iron bar.&nbsp; At the Brookhall Ditches also there is an oak
entirely variegated, containing 100 feet of timber; besides several other
fine trees near.&nbsp; There are five very large beech-trees growing about
two miles from Coleford on the road to Mitcheldean, and others likewise,
almost as large, on the Blaize Bailey, besides several more near Danby
Lodge; <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>but the finest of all the beeches in the Forest is near the
entrance to Whitemead Park, near York Lodge, measuring 17 feet at 6 feet
from the ground.&nbsp; Most of the lesser oaks which have become timber,
and have not been removed by the recent &ldquo;falls,&rdquo; are probably
the remains of the plantations made in 1670, such as the various
flourishing oaks which may be noticed near the Speech House, on the Lea
Bailey, the Lining Wood, and in a few other places.&nbsp; Many of the old
hollies seem to belong to the same date, being either indigenous, or
planted about this time to serve as food for the deer.&nbsp; One of the
largest of those growing near the Speech House measures 9 feet in girth at
4 feet from the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>During the earlier half of the last century the devastations were so
rapid as to necessitate re-enclosing and re-planting various parts, about
the year 1760; but the effort to restock the whole of the Forest as it now
appears was reserved to 1810 and the thirty subsequent years.&nbsp; Its
present aspect, with very few exceptions, is such as to afford the best
hopes that by the close <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>of the present century a large proportion of
the woods will be yielding profitable timber, provided the crops be duly
protected from injury, which otherwise the rapidly increasing population of
the neighbourhood will too surely occasion.&nbsp; Nine-tenths of the
present stock are oaks; the rest are Spanish chesnuts, Scotch fir, larch,
spruce, beech, and a few elms, sycamores, and horse-chesnuts; birch grows
spontaneously in most parts of the Forest.</p>

observed that the walk by the side of the Wye from Ross to Chepstow is said
to be the most productive in objects of botanical interest of any part of

<p>&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; writes Mr. Wyrrall, in his valuable MS. on the
ancient iron-works of the Forest, dated in the year 1780, &ldquo;deep in
the earth vast caverns scooped out by men&rsquo;s hands, and large as the
aisles of churches; and on its surface are extensive labyrinths, worked
among the rocks, and now long since overgrown with woods; which whosoever
traces them must see with astonishment, and incline to think them to have
been the work of armies rather than of private labourers.&nbsp; They
certainly were the toil of many centuries, and this perhaps before they
thought of searching in the bowels of the earth for their
ore&mdash;whither, however, they at length naturally pursued the veins, as
they found them to be exhausted near the surface.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were
the remains, as they existed in his day, of the original iron-mines of this
locality; and except where modern operations have obliterated them, such
they continue to the present time.&nbsp; Beyond the inference of remote
antiquity, which we naturally draw from the <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>fact of their
presenting no trace of the use of any kind of machinery, or of gunpowder,
or the display of any mining skill, we may cite the unanimous opinion of
the neighbourhood, that they owe their origin to the predecessors of that
peculiar order of operatives known as &ldquo;the free miners of the Forest
of Dean;&rdquo; a view which is confirmed by the authentic history of the
district.&nbsp; But the numerous Roman relics found deeply buried in the
prodigious accumulations of iron cinders, once so abundant here as to have
formed an important part of the materials supplied to the furnaces of the
Forest, afford proof that the iron-mines were in existence as early as the
commencement of the Christian era; so that the openings we now see are the
results of many centuries of mining operations, with which their extent,
number, and size perfectly accord.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>
<a href="images/p213.jpg">
<img alt="The Devil&rsquo;s Chapel" src="images/p213.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>These mines present the appearance either of spacious caves, as on the
Doward Hill, or at the Scowles near Bream, or they consist of precipitous
and irregularly shaped passages, left by the removal of the ore or mineral
earth wherever it was found, and which was followed in some instances for
many hundreds of yards, openings being made to the surface wherever the
course of the mine permitted, thus securing an efficient ventilation, so
that although they have been so long deserted the air in them is perfectly
good.&nbsp; They are also quite dry, owing probably to their being drained
by the new workings adjacent to them, and descending to a far greater
depth.&nbsp; In the first instance they were no doubt excavated as deep as
the water permitted, that is, to about 100 feet, or in dry seasons even
lower, as is in fact proved by the water-marks left in some of them.&nbsp;
Occasionally they are found adorned with beautiful incrustations of the
purest white, formed by springs of carbonate of lime, originating in the
rocky walls of limestone around.&nbsp; Sometimes, after proceeding a
considerable distance, they suddenly open out into spacious vaults fifteen
feet in width, the site probably of some valuable &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; or
&ldquo;churn&rdquo; of ore; and then again, where the supply was less
abundant, narrowing into a width hardly sufficient to admit the human
body.&nbsp; Occasionally the passage divides and unites again, or abruptly
stops, turning off at a sharp angle, or changing its level, where rude
steps cut in the rock show the mode by which the old miners ascended or
descended; whilst sometimes the rounds of ladders have been found,
semi-carbonized by age.&nbsp; These excavations abound on every side of the
Forest, wherever the iron makes its appearance, giving the name of
&ldquo;Meand&rdquo; or mine to such places.&nbsp; Of the deeper workings,
one of the most extensive occurs on the Lining Wood Hill above Mitcheldean,
and is well worth exploring.</p>
<p>The earliest historical allusion to these underground works is made by
Camden, who records that a gigantic <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>skeleton was found in
a cave on the Great Doward Hill, now called &ldquo;King Arthur&rsquo;s
Hall,&rdquo; being evidently the entrance to an ancient iron-mine.&nbsp;
The next refers to the period of the Great Rebellion, when the terrified
inhabitants of the district are said to have fled to them for safety when
pursued by the hostile soldiery of either party.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p215.jpg">
<img alt="&ldquo;King Arthur&rsquo;s Hall&rdquo;" src="images/p215.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Adverting, in the next place, to the heaps of cinders left where the
ancient iron-manufacturers of the district worked, their <i>quality</i>,
<i>abundance</i>, and <i>situation</i> suggest several interesting points
of observation.&nbsp; Thus, their <i>quality</i> proves that charcoal was
the fuel invariably employed, and the large percentage of metal left in
them shows that the process then in use of extracting the iron was very
imperfect.&nbsp; They are said to vary in richness according as they belong
to an earlier or later period&mdash;so much so, that some persons have
ventured on this data to specify their relative ages; but other causes may
have produced this difference.&nbsp; As to their <i>quantity</i>, it was
once so great, that, although they have formed a large part of the mineral
supply to the different <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>furnaces of the district for the last 200
years, they still abound for miles round the Forest, wherever human
habitations appear to have clustered, sometimes giving the names to places,
as &ldquo;Cinderford&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cinder Hill,&rdquo; or forming a
valuable consideration in the purchase of land containing them.</p>
<p>Equally remarkable with the two former characteristics of these cinders
is their <i>position</i>, not unfrequently on elevated spots and far
removed from any watercourse.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, the high
temperature necessary for acting upon the ore must have been obtained by
constructing the fireplace so as to create a powerful draft of air, the
fuel and mineral being placed alternately in layers within a circular
structure of stone, resembling the rude furnaces said to be used amongst
the natives of central Africa.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;<i>forgi&oelig; errantes</i>,&rdquo; or itinerant forges, <a
name="citation216"></a><a href="#footnote216" class="citation">[216]</a>
mentioned in the records of the Justice Seat held at Gloucester Castle in
1282, were no doubt improvements on the structures just mentioned, being at
the same time so formed as to admit of being removed and set at work
elsewhere, as is in fact intimated by the name given to them, as well as by
the more frequent occurrence and smaller size of those cinder-heaps which
are found nearer to the centre of the Forest; and consequently of more
modern date, presenting a striking contrast to the larger and more ancient
mounds existing in places more remote, the refuse of the earlier forges
kept at work for many years in one spot.</p>
<p>The moderate capacity of the <i>forgi&oelig; errantes</i> may be
inferred from the circumstance that in the reign of Edward I. there were
seventy-two of them in the Forest alone, supplied with ore by at least
fifty-nine iron-mines, by which Gloucester, Monmouth, Caerleon, Newport,
Berkeley, Trelleck, &amp;c., are stated in the Book of the Laws and Customs
of the Mine to have been furnished with that metal.&nbsp; We also know that
the two forges at Flaxley consumed two oaks every week, and <!-- page
217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>that in that
age &pound;46 was paid to the King by such persons as farmed any of them,
or 7s. if they held a year&rsquo;s licence.</p>
<p>In the year 1841, when that part of the old road leading up to the
Hawthorns from Hownal was altered, near the brook below Rudge Farm, the
hearths of five small forges, cut out of the sandstone rock, and curiously
pitched all round the bottom with small pebbles, were laid open, and an
iron tube seven or eight inches long, and one inch and a half bore,
apparently the nozzle of a pair of bellows, was found, as well as scores of
old tobacco pipes, bits of iron much rusted, and broken earthenware,
besides a piece of silver coin; but unfortunately none of these relics have
been preserved.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The heraldic crest here copied from a mutilated brass of the 15th
century, within the Clearwell Chapel of Newland Church, gives a curious
representation of the iron-miner of that period equipped for his
work.&nbsp; It represents him as wearing a cap, holding a candlestick
between his teeth, handling a small mattock with which to loosen, as
occasion required, the fine mineral earth lodged in the cavity within which
he worked, or else to detach the metallic incrustations lining its sides,
bearing a light wooden mine-hod on his back, suspended by a shoulderstrap,
and clothed in a thick flannel jacket, and short leathern breeches, <!--
page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>tied
with thongs below the knee.&nbsp; Although in this representation the lower
extremities are concealed, the numerous shoe-footed marks yet visible on
the moist beds of some of the old excavations prove that the feet were well
protected from injury by the rough rocks of the workings.&nbsp; Several
mattock-heads exactly resembling the one which this miner is holding have
also been discovered; and to enable us, as it were, to supply every
particular, small oak shovels for collecting the ore, and putting it into
the hod, have in some places been found.</p>

<img alt="Iron Mattock head" src="images/p218b.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The mining and making of iron continued to be carried on in the Forest
in the manner indicated by the foregoing particulars, until the improved
methods of manufacture established in other parts of the kingdom,
particularly in Sussex, had been adopted here.&nbsp; As early probably as
the commencement of the reign of Elizabeth, these improvements came into
use in this locality, and superseded the old &ldquo;make.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was for its iron-mines, even more than for its timber, that this Forest
excited the jealousy of the Spaniards, who designed to suppress the former
by destroying the charcoal fuel with which they were worked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p218c.jpg">
<img alt="Oak Shovel" src="images/p218c.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The earliest intimation of any such change in the mode of manufacture
occurs in the terms of a &ldquo;bargayne,&rdquo; made by the Crown, and
preserved in the Lansdowne MSS. &ldquo;w<sup>th</sup> Giles Brudges and
others,&rdquo; on 14th June, 1611, demising &ldquo;libertye to erect all
manner of workes, iron or other, by lande or water, excepting Wyer workes,
and the same to pull downe, remove, and alter att pleasure,&rdquo; with
&ldquo;libertye to take myne <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>oare and synders, either to be used att the
workes or otherwise,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; By &ldquo;synders&rdquo; is meant
the refuse of the old forges, but which by the new process could be made to
yield a profitable percentage of metal which the former method had failed
to extract.&nbsp; In the year following a similar &ldquo;bargayne&rdquo;
was made with William Earl of Pembroke, at the enormous rental of
&pound;2,433 6s. 3d., but with leave to take &ldquo;tymb<sup>r</sup> for
buildinges &amp; workes as they were,&rdquo; with &ldquo;allowance of
reasonable fireboote for the workmen out of the dead &amp; dry wood,
&amp;c., to inclose a garden not exceedinge halfe an acre to every house,
and likewise to inclose for the necessity of the worke; the houses and
inclosures to bee pulled downe &amp; layd open as the workes shall cease or
remove.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third and corresponding &ldquo;bargayne&rdquo; was
agreed to, on the 3rd of May, 1615, with Sir Basil Brook, there being
reserved in rent &ldquo;iron 320 tonns p. annum, w<sup>ch</sup> att
xii<sup>ll</sup> x<sup>s</sup> the tone cometh to 4,000 per an.: the rent
reserved to be payd in iron by 40 tonns p. month, w<sup>ch</sup> cometh to
500<sup>ll</sup> every month; so in toto yearelye
4,000<sup>ll</sup>;&rdquo; and a proviso that &ldquo;The workes already
buylt onlye granted, w<sup>th</sup> no power to remove them, but bound to
mayntayne and leave them in good case and repayre, w<sup>th</sup> all stock
of hammers, anvil&rsquo;s, and other necessarys received att the
pattentees&rsquo; entrye,&rdquo; as also that &ldquo;libertye for myne and
synders for supplying of the workes onlye, to be taken by delivery of the
miners att the price agreed uppon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1621 Messrs. Chaloner and Harris appear to have succeeded to the
works under a rent of &pound;2,000, and who, we may presume, cast the 610
guns ordered by the Crown on behalf of the States General of Holland in
1629.&nbsp; The spot where they were made was, it would seem, ever after
called &ldquo;Guns Mills.&rdquo;&nbsp; It certainly was so called as early
as the year 1680, an explanation of the term which is confirmed by the
discovery there of an ancient piece of ordnance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Guns
Pill&rdquo; was the place where they were afterwards shipped.</p>
<p>A curious inventory, dated 1635, of the buildings and machinery referred
to in the forenamed &ldquo;bargaynes,&rdquo; <!-- page 220--><a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>has been preserved
amongst the Wyrrall Papers, and is inserted in the Appendix No. IV.</p>
<p>As to the length of time the works specified in Appendix No. IV.
continued in operation, the late Mr. Mushet, who knew the neighbourhood
intimately, in his valuable &ldquo;Papers on Iron,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
considers that they were finally abandoned shortly after that date (1635),
since, &ldquo;with the exception of the slags, traces of the water mounds,
and the faint lines of the watercourses, not a vestige of any of them
remains.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, &ldquo;About fourteen years ago I first saw
the ruins of one of these furnaces, situated below York Lodge, and
surrounded by a large heap of slag or scoria that is produced in making pig
iron.&nbsp; As the situation of this furnace was remote from roads, and
must at one time have been deemed nearly inaccessible, it had all the
appearance at the time of my survey of having remained in the same state
for nearly two centuries.&nbsp; The quantity of slags I computed at from
8,000 to 10,000 tons.&nbsp; If it is assumed that this furnace made upon an
average annually 200 tons of pig iron, and that the quantity of slag run
from the furnace was equal to one half the quantity of iron made, we shall
have 100 tons of cinders annually, for a period of from 80 to 100
years.&nbsp; If the abandonment of this furnace took place about the year
1640, the commencement of its smeltings must be assigned to a period
between the years 1540 and 1560.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oldest piece of cast iron which Mr. Mushet states he ever saw,
exhibited the arms of England, with the initials E. R., and bore date 1555,
but he found no specimen in the Forest earlier than 1620.&nbsp; He also
observes, that, &ldquo;although he had carefully examined every spot and
relic in Dean Forest likely to denote the site of Dud Dudley&rsquo;s
enterprising but unfortunate experiment of making iron with pit
coal,&rdquo; it had been without success, and the same with the like
operations of Cromwell, who was partner with Major Wildman, Captain Birch,
and other of his officers, Doctors of Physic and Merchants, by whom works
and furnaces had been set up in the Forest, at a vast charge.</p>
<p><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>In 1650 a Committee of the House of Commons ordered that all the
iron-works in the Forest, formerly let on lease by the Crown, should be
suppressed and demolished, partly perhaps with the view of checking the
consumption of wood, and also to put a stop to the making of cannon and
shot, lest when the occasion invited they should be seized by the adverse
party and turned against them.&nbsp; The Royalists had already found here a
valuable store of such things at the time they were defending Bristol
against Fairfax.</p>
<p>How far the above mandate was obeyed does not appear, but ere the year
1674 a general decay seems to have fallen on the Forest works, as in that
year the expediency of repairing them, and building an additional furnace
and two forges, at the cost of &pound;1,000, was suggested.&nbsp; The
opposite course was, however, recommended, that is, of demolishing them
all, lest they should ultimately cause the destruction of the wood and
timber, a course which it seems was followed, since in the 4th order of the
Mine Law Court, dated 27th April, 1680, they are stated to have been lately
demolished.&nbsp; The same &ldquo;Order&rdquo; fixes the following prices
as those at which twelve Winchester bushels of iron mine should be
delivered at the following places:&mdash;St. Wonnarth&rsquo;s furnace 10s.,
Whitchurch 7s., Linton 9s., Bishopswood 9s., Longhope 9s., Flaxley 8s.,
Gunsmills (if rebuilt) 7s., Blakeney 6s., Lydney 6s.; at those in the
Forest, if rebuilt, the same as in 1668&mdash;Redbrooke 4s. 6d., The Abbey
(Tintern) 9s., Brockweare 6s. 6d., Redbrooke Passage 5s. 6d., Gunpill 7s.,
or ore (intended for Ireland) shipped on the Severn 6s. 6d.</p>
<p>Most of these localities exhibit traces of former iron manufacture
having been carried on at them up to the commencement of that century, as
at Flaxley, Bishopswood, &amp;c., charcoal being the fuel invariably used,
and their situation such that water power was at command.&nbsp; The prices
severally affixed to the places above named indicate a discontinuance of
the mines on the north-east side of the Forest, those adjoining Newland and
in Noxon Park being at this date the chief <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>sources of supply,
agreeably with the allusions to iron-pits existing there which occur in the
proceedings of the Mine Law Court about that time.&nbsp; The mode then in
use of operating upon the iron ore, as described in MS. by Dr. Parsons,
will be found in Appendix No. V.</p>
<p>Andrew Yarranton, in his book of novel suggestions for the
&ldquo;Improvement of England by Sea and Land,&rdquo; printed in 1677,
remarks as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;And first, I will begin in Monmouthshire,
and go through the Forest of Dean, and there take notice what infinite
quantities of raw iron is there made, with bar iron and wire; and consider
the infinite number of men, horses, and carriages which are to supply these
works, and also digging of ironstone, providing of cinders, carrying to the
works, making it into sows and bars, cutting of wood and converting into
charcoal.&nbsp; Consider also, in all these parts, the woods are not worth
the cutting and bringing home by the owners to burn in their houses; and it
is because in all these places there are pit coal very cheap . . .&nbsp; If
these advantages were not there, it would be little less than a howling
wilderness.&nbsp; I believe, if this comes to the hands of Sir Baynom
Frogmorton and Sir Duncomb Colchester, they will be on my side.&nbsp;
Moreover, there is yet a most great benefit to the kingdom in general by
the sow iron made of the ironstone and Roman cinders in the Forest of Dean,
for that metal is of a most gentle, pliable, soft nature, easily and
quickly to be wrought into manufacture, over what any other iron is, and it
is the best in the known world: and the greatest part of this sow iron is
sent up Severne to the forges into Worcester, Shropshire, Staffordshire,
Warwickshire, and Cheshire, and there it&rsquo;s made into bar iron: and
because of its kind and gentle nature to work, it is now at Sturbridge,
Dudley, Wolverhampton, Sedgley, Wasall, and Burmingham, and there bent,
wrought, and manufactured into all small commodities, and diffused all
England over, and thereby a great trade made of it; and when manufactured,
into most parts of the world.&nbsp; And I can very easily make it appear,
that in the <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>Forest of Dean and thereabouts, and about the material that comes
from thence, there are employed and have their subsistence therefrom no
less than 60,000 persons.&nbsp; And certainly, if this be true, then it is
certain it is better these iron-works were up and in being than that there
were none.&nbsp; And it were well if there were an Act of Parliament for
enclosing all common fit or any way likely to bear wood in the Forest of
Dean and six miles round the Forest; and that great quantities of timber
might by the same law be there preserved, for to supply in future ages
timber for shipping and building.&nbsp; And I dare say the Forest of Dean
is, as to the iron, to be compared to the sheep&rsquo;s back as to the
woollen; nothing being of more advantage to England than these two are . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Forest of Dean and thereabouts the iron is made at this
day of cinders, being the rough and offal thrown by in the Romans&rsquo;
time; they then having only foot blasts to melt the ironstone, but now, by
the force of a great wheel that drives a pair of bellows twenty feet long,
all that iron is extracted out of the cinders, which could not be forced
from it by the Roman foot blast.&nbsp; And in the Forest of Dean and
thereabouts, and as high as Worcester, there are great and infinite
quantities of these cinders; some in vast mounts above ground, some under
ground, which will supply the iron-works some hundreds of years, and these
cinders are they which make the prime and best iron, and with much less
charcoal than doth the ironstone . . .&nbsp; Let there be one ton of this
bar-iron made of Forest ironstone, and &pound;20 will be given for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a paper examined by Mr. Mushet, and referring probably to
the year 1720 or 1730, the iron-making district of the Forest of Dean
contained ten blast furnaces, viz. six in Gloucestershire, three in
Herefordshire, and one at Tintern, making their total number just equal to
that of the then iron-making district of Sussex.&nbsp; In Mr.
Taylor&rsquo;s map of Gloucestershire, published in 1777, iron furnaces,
forges, or engines are <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span

Wear, Upper Red Brook, Park End, Bradley, and Flaxley.&nbsp; Yet only a
small portion of the mineral used at these works was obtained from the Dean
Forest mines, if we may judge from the statement made by Mr. Hopkinson, in
1788, before the Parliamentary Commissioners, to the effect that
&ldquo;there is no regular iron-mine work now carried on in the said
Forest, but there were about twenty-two poor men who, at times when they
had no other work to do, employed themselves in searching for and getting
iron mine or ore in the old holes and pits in the said Forest, which have
been worked out many years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a practice is well remembered
by the aged miners, the chief part of the ore used coming by sea from
Whitehaven.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Mushet represents, &ldquo;at Tintern the furnace
charge for forge pig iron was generally composed of a mixture of
seven-eighths of Lancashire iron ore, and one-eighth part of a lean
calcareous sparry iron ore from the Forest of Dean, called flux, the
average yield of which mixture was fifty per cent of iron.&nbsp; When in
full work, Tintern Abbey charcoal furnace made weekly from twenty-eight to
thirty tons of charcoal forge pig iron, and consumed forty dozen sacks of
charcoal; so that sixteen sacks of charcoal were consumed in making one ton
of pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; This furnace was, he believes, &ldquo;the first
charcoal furnace which in this country was blown with air compressed in
iron cylinders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The year 1795 marks the period when the manufacture of iron was resumed
in the Forest by means of pit coal cokes at Cinderford, the above date
being preserved on an inscription stone in No. 1 furnace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
conductors of the work succeeded,&rdquo; in the words of Mr. Bishop,
communicated to the Author, &ldquo;as to fact, and made pig iron of good
quality; but from the rude and insufficient character of their
arrangements, they failed commercially as a speculation, the quantity
produced not reaching twenty tons per week.&nbsp; The cokes were brought
from Broadmoor in boats, by a small canal, the embankment of which may be
seen at the present <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>day.&nbsp; The ore was carried down to the
furnaces on mules&rsquo; backs, from Edge Hill and other mines.&nbsp; The
rising tide of iron manufacture in Wales and Staffordshire could not fail
to swamp such ineffectual arrangements, and as a natural consequence
Cinderford sank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attempts still continued to be made from time to time in the
locality, but the want of success, and the loss of large capital, placed
the whole neighbourhood under a ban.&nbsp; It was during this interval that
the name of David Mushet appears in connexion with the Forest.&nbsp; He
made his first essay at White Cliff, near Coleford, in partnership with a
Mr. Alford.&nbsp; The result was the loss of the entire investment, and the
dismantling of the works, except the shell of the building, as a monument
over the grave of departed thousands.&nbsp; A large quantity of the
castings were brought to Cinderford in 1827, and were connected with the
blast apparatus attached to those works.&nbsp; The names of Birt and Teague
now occasionally appeared, combined with attempts to retrieve the character
of the locality for iron making; but all failed: and Mr. Mushet&rsquo;s
famous declaration that physical difficulties would for ever prevent its
success, in connexion with such repeated failures, seemed for several years
to have sealed up the prospects of the Forest; but at length a glimmer of
light broke through the darkness, and it was reserved for an individual of
Forest birth to prove that the greatest theorists may arrive at wrong
practical conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moses Teague was the day-star who ushered in a bright morning
after a dark and gloomy night.&nbsp; Great natural genius, combined with a
rare devotion to the interests of the Forest, led him to attempt a solution
of the difficulty.&nbsp; In this he so far succeeded at Dark Hill, in the
cupola formerly used by Mr. Mushet, that he formed a company, consisting of
Messrs. Whitehouse, James, and Montague, who took a lease of Park End
Furnace about the year 1825, erected a large water-wheel to blow the
furnace, and got to work in <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>1826.&nbsp; Having started this concern, Mr.
Teague, who from constitutional tendencies was always seeking something
new, and considered nothing done while aught remained to do, cast his eye
on Cinderford, which he thought presented the best prospects in the
locality; and after making arrangments with Messrs. Montague, Church, and
Fraser, those gentlemen with himself formed the first &lsquo;Cinderford
Iron Company,&rsquo; the writer joining the undertaking when the
foundations of the buildings were being laid.&nbsp; The scheme comprehended
two blast furnaces, a powerful blast engine still at work, finery, forge,
and rolling-mill, designed to furnish about forty tons of tinplate per week
with collieries and mine work.&nbsp; Before the completion of the
undertaking it was found that the outlay so far exceeded their expectations
and means, that the concern became embarrassed almost before it was
finished, which, with the then great depression of the iron trade during
the years 1829 to 1832 inclusive, led to the stoppage of the works, which
had continued in operation from November 1829 till the close of 1832, in
which state they continued to 1835, when Mr. Teague again came to the
rescue, and induced Mr. William Allaway, a gentleman in the tinplate trade,
of Lydbrook, to form, in connexion with Messrs. Crawshay, another
company.&nbsp; Mr. Teague having retired from the management of the
furnaces, that important post was filled by Mr. James Broad, a man of great
practical knowledge, who for twenty years succeeded in making iron at
Cinderford furnaces of quality and in quantities which had never been
anticipated.&nbsp; There are now four blast furnaces, three of which are
always in blast, and a new blast engine of considerable power is in course
of erection, in addition to the old engine which has been puffing away for
twenty-eight years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adverting, in the next place, to the iron-works at Park End, the
Reverend H. Poole kindly supplies the following facts, courteously
communicated by the proprietors:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The year 1799 gives the date of the oldest iron <!-- page
227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>furnace
here, situated about half a mile below the original works, and carried on
by a Mr. Perkins.&nbsp; They were afterwards sold to Mr. John Protheroe,
who disposed of the same to his nephew, Edward Protheroe, Esq., formerly
M.P. for Bristol, who had extensive grants of coal in the immediate
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In 1824 Mr. Protheroe granted a lease of the furnace
and premises, and also sundry iron-mines, to &lsquo;the Forest of Dean Iron
Company,&rsquo; then consisting of Messrs. Montague, James, &amp;c., until
in 1826 Messrs. William Montague of Gloucester, and John James, Esq., of
Lydney, became the sole lessees.&nbsp; These parties, in 1827, erected
another furnace, and also an immense waterwheel of 51 feet diameter and 6
feet wide, said to be nearly the largest in the kingdom, and formed
extensive and suitable ponds and canals for the supply of water.&nbsp; This
water-wheel was but little used, in consequence of the general introduction
and superior advantages of steam power, which was obtained by erecting an
engine for creating the blast.&nbsp; It was considered insufficient,
however, for supplying two furnaces on the blast principle, each of which
was 45 feet high, 8 feet diameter at the top, 14 feet diameter at the
boshes, and 4 feet 6 inches diameter at the hearth; hence another
steam-engine of 80 horse power was erected in 1849, but in consequence of a
depression in the iron trade, and other causes, the two furnaces were not
then worked together.&nbsp; A few years after the decease of Mr. Montague,
in 1847, Mr. James purchased all his interest in the works, and became the
sole lessee until the year 1854, when he purchased of Mr. Protheroe the fee
of the property, together with all the liabilities of the lease.&nbsp;
Since that time the two furnaces have been constantly worked together,
under the superintendence of Mr. Greenham, one of the proprietors, the firm
still continuing as &lsquo;the Forest of Dean Iron
Company.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the year 1851 extensive tinplate works were commenced at Park
End, and 24 houses were built for the workmen, by Messrs. James and
Greenham, at a <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>considerable outlay.&nbsp; These works when
completed were afterwards sold to Messrs. T. and W. Allaway, who enlarged
and improved the same, and are now carried on with much spirit and
success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tinworks at Lydney are also in the hands of the above-named firm,
and comprise three forges, mills, and tin-house, producing 1200 boxes of
tin plates a week, with the consumption of from 70 to 80 tons of Cinderford
iron.&nbsp; The Lydney iron-works belonged in early times to the Talbot
family.</p>
<p>At Lydbrook there are the &ldquo;Upper&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lower&rdquo;
works.&nbsp; The latter, or those nearest the Wye, are said to have
belonged originally to the Foleys, one of whom was elected a free miner in
1754.&nbsp; Mr. Partridge carried them on for many years in connexion with
the furnaces at Bishopswood, but leased them in 1817 to Mr. Allaway, at
which time they comprised three forges, rolling and bar mills, and
tin-house complete, capable of producing 100 to 150 boxes of tin plates per
week.&nbsp; Under the able management of Mr. Allaway&rsquo;s sons, the
works now yield 600 boxes, sent off by the Wye, the iron used being that
from Cinderford, as best suited for the purpose.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Upper&rdquo; works were once farmed for Lord Gage, but they now
belong to Messrs. Russell, who make large quantities of wire for the
electrical telegraph, as well as iron for smith&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>The iron-works at Sowdley are all that remain to be noticed.&nbsp; Here,
as early as 1565, iron wire is said to have been made, being drawn by
strength of hand.&nbsp; In 1661 Mr. Paysted states that the factory passed
from Roynon Jones, Esq., of Hay Hill, into the hands of a party named
Parnell and Co., who carried on the works until the year 1784, from which
date to 1804 Dobbs and Taylor had them.&nbsp; From 1824 on to 1828 they
were held by Browning, Heaven, and Tryer; but in the latter year Todd,
Jeffries, and Spirrin undertook the business, converting a part of the
premises into paint and brass works, which lasted for about four
years.&nbsp; Two blast furnaces were built on the spot in 1837 by Edward
Protheroe, Esq., who worked them for four years.&nbsp; In <!-- page
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>1857 they
were purchased by Messrs. Gibbon, and are now in blast.</p>
<p>Eight blast furnaces were at work in the Forest in the year 1856, and
produced upwards of 24,132 tons of iron of the best quality.</p>
<p>It only remains to state that twenty iron-mines were awarded by the
Mining Commissioners in 1841, and these are since increased to upwards of
fifty, several of them comprising very extensive workings, and are
furnished with very powerful pumping engines; that at Shakemantle raises
198&frac14; gallons per stroke, and the one at Westbury Brook 24 gallons,
from a depth of 186 yards.</p>
<p>The annual yield of iron mine from the four principal pits

1856 from the ten largest collieries.</p>
<p>There is a difficulty in determining which is to be considered the
earliest allusion to the working of coal in the Forest, since charcoal as
well as sea or pit coal was thus indifferently designated: not that the
latter was carried by sea, but only that it agreed in character with the
coal usually so conveyed.&nbsp; The first notice seems, however, to be that
supplied by the records of the Justice Seat held at Gloucester in 1282,
where it is stated that sea coal was claimed by six of the ten bailiffs of
the Forest of Dean.</p>
<p>The appellation of &ldquo;Sea Coal Mine&rdquo; as distinguished from
&ldquo;the Oare Mine,&rdquo; mentioned in the 29th section of &ldquo;The
Laws and Customs of the Miners in the Forest of Dean,&rdquo; compiled about
the year 1300, likewise proves that sea-coal was known by name, and that a
description of fuel closely resembling it was then dug in this
neighbourhood, to an extent entitling it to be noticed &ldquo;as free in
all points&rdquo; with the long celebrated iron ore; that is, constituting
the collier a free miner.</p>
<p>The original methods of getting coal in the locality probably conformed
to the modes then used for obtaining the iron mine, the veins of both
minerals showing themselves on the surface much in the same manner.&nbsp;
So that it is probable the old coal-workings, like those for iron,
descended only to a moderate depth, and for <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>the same reason were
frequently carried on by driving levels, for which the position of several
of the coal-seams was highly favourable.</p>
<p>In the year 1610 &ldquo;liberty to dig for and take, within any part of
the Forest or the precincts thereof, such and so much sea-coal as should be
necessary for carrying on the iron-works,&rdquo; was granted to William,
Earl of Pembroke, by James I.&nbsp; This is the earliest mention of coal
being so used, agreeably to the efforts then making by Simon Sturtevant and
John Ravenzon, Esqrs., to adapt it by baking for such a purpose.&nbsp; The
same grant, in omitting to mention coal amongst certain other productions
which &ldquo;no person or persons were to take or carry out of the said
Forest,&rdquo; leads to the supposition that coal was then exported or
carried into the adjacent country, and that it was found desirable for this
to continue.&nbsp; Coal was included in Charles I.&rsquo;s sale of the
Forest timber, iron, stone, &amp;c., to Sir John Winter, who some years
afterwards is described by Evelyn as interested in a project for
&ldquo;charring sea-coal,&rdquo; so as to render it fit for the iron
furnace.&nbsp; A scheme somewhat similar was now tried in the Forest, Mr.
Mushet tells us, by Captain Birch, Major Wildman, and others, &ldquo;where
they erected large air furnaces, into which they introduced large clay
pots, resembling those used at glasshouses, filled with various proportions
of the necessary mixture of ores and charcoal.&nbsp; The furnaces were
heated by the flame of pit-coal, and it was expected that, by tapping the
pots below, the separated materials would flow out.&nbsp; This rude process
was found entirely impracticable; the heat was inadequate to perfect
separation, the pots cracked, and in a short time the process was abandoned
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The important Act of 1668 confirmed to persons digging for coal in the
Forest their lawful rights and privileges, as also to the Crown the liberty
to lease the coal-mines for a period not exceeding thirty-one years.&nbsp;
This latter provision was immediately acted upon, the coal-mines and
quarries of grindstones being granted to Francis Tyrringham, Esq., for
thirty-one years, at a <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>rental of &pound;30 per annum, a price which,
if it were fairly agreed upon, affords some intimation of the extent and
value of the Forest coal-works at that time.</p>
<p>By the first &ldquo;Order&rdquo; of the Court of Mine Law, dated March
18th of the year last named (1668), it was fixed that a dozen bushels of
lime-coal should be disposed of for 3s. at the Lime Slad; for 5s. 6d. at
the top of the Little Doward; for 5s. 4d. at any other kilns thereon; for
5s. at the Buckstones; for 5s. 6d. at Monmouth; for 4s. at the Weare over
Wye; for 4s. if on this side; for 3s. 6d. at Coldwall; for 3s. at Lydbrook;
and for 4s. 4d. at Redbrook.</p>
<p>The second &ldquo;Order&rdquo; of the same Court, agreed to on the 9th
of March, 1674, provides that &ldquo;the servants of the Deputy Constable
shall always be first served at the pitts.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same year a
petition was presented to the Crown by several gentlemen and freeholders of
the parish of Newland for leave to drain some coal-pits at Milkwall,
stating that &ldquo;the inhabitants of the adjacent country were supplied
from the collieries of the Forest with coal for firing, and also for lime
coal, without which there would be little tillage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next Mine Law Court, held on the 8th of September, 1678, determined
that a barrel or three Winchester bushels should be the constant measure
for coal, four-pence being the smallest price allowed to be taken for
&ldquo;a barrel&rdquo; of fire coal.&nbsp; &ldquo;And whereas the myners
within this Forest are at a very great charge to make surffes for the
dreyning of their pitts to get cole, w<sup>ch</sup> when they have finished
others sincke pitts so near them that they are deprived of the benefit of
their labour and charge, to their very great loss and damage: To remedie
whereof, it is now ordered that after a surffe is made, noe myner shall
come to work within 100 yards of that surffe to the prejudice of the
undertakers without their consents, and without being contributory to the
making of the said surffe, upon payne of forfeiting 100 dozen of good fire
coale, the one moiety to the King&rsquo;s Ma<sup>tie</sup>, and the other
to the myner that shall sue for the same.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fourth
&ldquo;Order&rdquo; of <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>the same Court, issued on the 27th April,
1680, directs &ldquo;that no fire cole, smith&rsquo;s cole, or lyme cole
shall be delivered upon the bankes of the Wye between Monmouth Bridge and
Huntsame Ferry for less than 8s. a dozen bushels for the two former sorts,
and 4s. 6d. for lyme cole, or if between Huntsame Ferry and Wilton Bridge
for less than 3s. 6d. a dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 19th September, 1682, a fifth &ldquo;Order&rdquo; forbade
&ldquo;the transport of lime coal to Hereford and Monmouthshire at lower
rates than heretofore have been set and agreed upon,&rdquo; and ordained
that &ldquo;whensoever any collyers have fully wrought out a cole pitt
through w<sup>ch</sup> the gout water must necessarily run for drayning of
the worke, in such case the said collyers shall secure the said pitt, upon
payne to forfeite 100 dozen of good fire cole.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the ensuing
&ldquo;Order,&rdquo; dated 1st December, 1685, the jury agreed that, in
raising money for any public purpose, &ldquo;one half of those who served
should be cole myners, and the other half myners at iron oare,&rdquo; both
classes of operatives having at length become equally numerous, in
consequence of the rapid increase of the coal-works.&nbsp; The next Court
of the Mine, held on 5th April, 1687, decided that &ldquo;all cole pitts
and dangerous mine pitts which are not in working, or w<sup>ch</sup>
thereafter shall not be wrought in for one whole month together, shall be
sufficiently secured by a wall of stone, or by railing the same with posts
and railes placed above two feet distant from the mouth of such pitt by the
proprietor thereof, and likewise all pitts left open for a grout way, upon
paine of 10s. to be forfeited for every omission and neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the eighth verdict of the miners&rsquo; jury, declared on
the 13th of January, 1692, the former space of 100 yards, within which all
colliers were prohibited from coming to work another pit, was now extended
to 300 yards.&nbsp; The next &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; being that of the 25th of
April, 1694, directs that &ldquo;the price of fire cole to the copper works
(Redbrook) shal bee henceforth 8s. per dozen, and smith cole 6s. per
dozen.&rdquo;&nbsp; That of the 10th of March, 1701, enacted that
&ldquo;every miner shall <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>keepe a paire of scales at their severall
colepitts to weigh theire cole w<sup>th</sup>all,&rdquo; that none should
be sent away unweighed, and that the price of it should not exceed 5s. a
ton to the inhabitants of the hundred of St. Briavel&rsquo;s, or less than
6s. a ton to foreigners.&nbsp; The next &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; that of the
1st of July, 1707, renewed the direction to fill or sufficiently secure any
dangerous coal-pits, within some reasonable time, under a penalty of
20s.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Order&rdquo; dated 12th November, 1728, directs that
the distance of 300 yards between any adjoining works be &ldquo;augmented
to 500 yards in all levels.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Order&rdquo; bearing
date 2nd March, 1741, particularizes certain coal-works near Lydbrook
called &ldquo;Wyrrall Hill,&rdquo; another called &ldquo;Dowler&rsquo;s
Chambers,&rdquo; and likewise the coal-works called
&ldquo;Speedwell,&rdquo; at Serridge, besides &ldquo;the Hill Works&rdquo;
near Ruerdean.&nbsp; It also forbade any coal to be sold in the city of
Hereford under 13s. the ton, fixing a horse-load at 2&frac14; cwt., for 6d.
a bushel at the pit, one cwt. of fire coal for 4d. a bushel, three bushels
of smith&rsquo;s coal for 5d., and lime coal for 1d. a bushel, or 21 cwt.
of fire coal for 7s. 6d. &ldquo;waid and delivered&rdquo; at Lydney Pill or
at Pyrton Pill, or at Gatcombe.&nbsp; The same &ldquo;Order&rdquo; further
directs that &ldquo;the yearns belonging to the levels which are between
Drybrooke and Cannop&rsquo;s Bridge, and between Seridge and Reuardean
Town, shall get coal out of no more than two pitts at one time, belonging
to one level, till the said two pitts are worked quite out, and those who
keep two pitts in work on one level shall not sinke any other new pitt till
the old ones are quite worked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last of the &ldquo;Orders&rdquo; of the Miners&rsquo; Court, dated
October 22nd, 1754, provides that &ldquo;none shall sink any water pit and
get coal out of it within the limits or bounds of 1,000 yards of any level,
and that the waterwheel ingine at the Oiling Green near Broadmore be taken
to be a level to all intents and purposes, as all other levels brought up
from the Grassmoore;&rdquo; meaning probably, that they also were to enjoy
the protective distance of 1,000 yards in common with all
&ldquo;levels,&rdquo; <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>otherwise that distance would be no more than
twelve yards radius, according to the received custom.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
water-wheel engine,&rdquo; for working the pumps belonging to the work at
Oiling Green, is considered to have been the first of the kind, and
therefore marks the earliest of the successive steps made within the last
100 years in improving the methods of raising coal in this locality, by
showing greater ingenuity in removing the water from the pits, which were
now evidently sunk much deeper than formerly.</p>

&ldquo;the Oiling Gin&rdquo; as originally galed in 1766, and transferred
by agreement, dated 15th April, 1776, to a company, in consideration of
&pound;2,100, at whose cost the first &ldquo;fire-engine,&rdquo;
constructed, probably, on Watt&rsquo;s principle, patented in the previous
year, is understood to have been put up in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; It
also specifies the &ldquo;Brown&rsquo;s Green Colliery&rdquo; near
Lydbrook, opened in 1772; the &ldquo;Moorwood Coal Works&rdquo; in 1773;
&ldquo;Arthur&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo; in 1774, begun in the &ldquo;Thirty
Acres,&rdquo; and brought up into &ldquo;Little Cross Hill;&rdquo; and also
the undertaking called &ldquo;The Gentlemen Colliers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 26th August, 1777, the Court of Mine Law, by which the coal-works
in the Forest had been ever regulated, sat, as it proved, for the last
time, having been held according as business required three or four times a
year, with some few exceptions, since 1668.&nbsp; A memorandum with which
its last minute is endorsed is thus expressed:&mdash;&ldquo;Mine Law Court,
26 August, 1777.&nbsp; There has been no Court holden for the miners since
this day, which is a great loss to the gaveller, and causes various
disputes amongst the colliers, which is owing to the neglect of the
Deputy-Constables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A careful perusal of the papers in which the proceedings of the Court of
Mine Law are recorded from 30th April, 1706, supplies the following
particulars illustrative of the manner in which the miners of the first
half of the 18th century conducted their works, together with the usages of
the Court then in vogue.&nbsp; Nearly all the sittings were held at the
Speech-house, under the <!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>supervision of the deputies for the time being
of the Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, attended by the clerk of
the court, and the gaveller or his deputy.&nbsp; Rarely more than twelve,
but sometimes twenty-four miners constituted the jury; the suits they had
to try being mostly for debts and trespasses between miner and miner, such
as for leaving open dangerous pits, breaking &ldquo;forbids,&rdquo;
refusing to pay tax for defending the rights of the mine, loading
&ldquo;foreigners&rsquo;&rdquo; teams at the pits, for perjury, for keeping
more than four horses in carrying coal, or for removing pit lamps, scores
or cowls, &amp;c.&nbsp; Copies of two such entries, with other proceedings
of the Court as specimens, are given in the Appendix No. VI.</p>
<p>As early as the year 1718 the proceedings of the Court were occasionally
disturbed by the persons attending it.&nbsp; Thus, on the 13th of May, the
following amercements were made and recorded:&mdash;</p>

<p>Writing upon the subject of the Forest collieries, about the year 1779,
Mr. Rudder remarks in his History of the county,&mdash;&ldquo;The pits are
not deep, for when the miners find themselves much incommoded with water,
they sink a new one, rather than erect a fire engine, which might answer
the expense very well, yet there is not one of them in all this
division.&nbsp; They have indeed two or three pumps worked by cranks, that
in some measure answer the intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1788 we are informed by the evidence of the Gaveller, that,
according to an account made out in the previous August, &ldquo;there were
then within the Forest 121 coal-pits (thirty-one of which were not actually
in work), which pits produced 1,816 tons of coal per week; that there were
662 free miners concerned and <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>employed therein; and that the annual
compositions paid by them amounted to &pound;215 8s. or thereabouts,
although many of them were so poor that no money could be collected from
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At this time,&rdquo; says the same officer,
&ldquo;house-fire coal, on the Mitcheldean side the Forest, is sold at the
pit&rsquo;s mouth for 4s. 6d. per ton of 20 cwt., smith&rsquo;s coal 3s.
3d., lime coal 2s. per ton.&nbsp; When sold by the waggonload at the
pit&rsquo;s mouth, and the purchaser brings victuals and drink for the
colliers, the price of a waggonload was 10s. of house-fire coal, smith coal
6s. 6d., lime coal 4s.&nbsp; On the Coleford side the Forest, house-fire
coal was sold at the pit&rsquo;s mouth for 3s. 9d. per ton of 20 cwt.,
smith coal 2s. 9d., lime coal 1s. 3d.&nbsp; By the waggonload at the
pit&rsquo;s mouth, house-fire coal 8s. 6d., smith coal 5s. 6d., lime coal
2s. 6d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Assistant Deputy Surveyor of the same
period reported,&mdash;&ldquo;the parts of the Forest in which the
principal collieries are situate are these:&mdash;The Level of the Fire
Engine Colliery, which is one of the principal works, is in the bottom
between Nail Bridge and Cinderford Bridge, and there are pits all along the
Bottom.&nbsp; There are several Levels in the Bottom from Beechenhurst Hill
along the Delves quite up to Nail Bridge.&nbsp; Another large field of coal
from Whitecroft Bridge, at the back of White Mead Park along the Delves to
Great Moseley Green, and from thence through Old Vallet Tuft and Aures
Glow, almost up to Little Stapleage.&nbsp; These are the works which do the
greatest mischief to the Forest.&nbsp; There are some others on the
Coleford side, from which a great deal of coal is raised.&nbsp; Very little
timber is growing in any of these Delves; and enclosures might be made in
the Forest, so as to exclude all the principal coal-works.&nbsp; The
coal-works in the Forest supply with fuel the lower parts of
Gloucestershire beyond Severn, and some parts across the Severn about
Berkeley, the greatest part of Herefordshire, the town of Monmouth, and
part of the county of Monmouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The existing remains of the coal-works of this period, <!-- page
239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>combined
with the traditions of the oldest surviving colliers, enable us to form an
accurate idea of the way in which the workings were carried on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Levels,&rdquo; or slightly ascending passages, driven into the hill
sides till they struck the coal seam, appear to have been general.&nbsp;
This was no doubt owing to the facility with which they effected the
getting of the coal where it tended upwards into the higher lands forming
the edge of the Forest Coal Basin, since they required no winding
apparatus, and provided a discharge for the water which drained from the
coal-beds.&nbsp; The usages observed at the works entitled the proprietors
of their respective levels to so much of the corresponding seam of coal as
they could drain, extending right and left to the limits awarded by the
gaveller.&nbsp; So far this mode of procedure was satisfactory enough, and
would no doubt have long continued to go on amicably, had not the
principle, highly judicious in itself, that no workings were ever to
intersect one another, but always to stop when the mattocks met, been
abused by driving &ldquo;narrow headings&rdquo; up into different workings,
whereby the rightful owner of the coal was stopped, and the other party
enabled to come in and take it from him.&nbsp; Timber of considerable
strength was required throughout the underground excavations to support the
roof, hence proving a serious source of spoliation to the woods.&nbsp;
Large slabs of it were also needed for the flooring, in order that the
small coal-trams might be the more readily pushed forward over it, a space
being left beneath for air to circulate, and for the water to run out.</p>
<p>If the vein of coal proposed to be worked did not admit of being reached
by a level, then a pit was sunk to it, although rarely to a greater depth
than 25 yards, the water being raised in buckets, or by a water-wheel
engine, or else by a drain having its outlet in some distant but lower
spot, such as is found to have led from the Broad Moor Collieries to
Cinderford, a mile and upwards in length.&nbsp; The shaft of the pit was
made of a square form, in order that its otherwise insecure sides might be
the better supported by suitable woodwork, <!-- page 240--><a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>which being
constructed in successive stages was occasionally used as a ladder, the
chief difficulty being found in keeping the workings free from water, which
in wet seasons not unfrequently gained the mastery and drowned the men
out.&nbsp; The skips appear to have been always rectangular in shape,
similar to the shafts.</p>
<p>Intermediately between the date of the above coal-works and the present
most approved collieries, Mr. Protheroe, in his evidence before the Dean
Forest Commissioners, in 1832, relative to his thirty-two coal-pits, stated
that &ldquo;the depth of my principal pits at Park End and Bilson varies
from about 150 to 200 yards; that of my new gales, for which I have engine
licences, is estimated at from 250 to 300 yards.&nbsp; I have 12 steam
engines varying from 12 to 140 horse power, 9 or 10 of which are at work,
the whole amounting to 500 horse power; and I have licences for four more
engines, two of which must be of very great power.&nbsp; The amount of
wages paid by me, in the last twelve years, to colliers, hauliers, and
labourers, is upwards of &pound;150,000, giving constant employment on the
average to from 400 to 500 individuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coal-pits were now lined throughout with stone walling, leaving a
clear diameter of from 7 to 9 feet; greater regard was paid to their
drainage and ventilation, both of which required particular attention,
owing to the watery nature of the coal measures, and the abundance of
&ldquo;choke-damp,&rdquo; although happily &ldquo;fire damp&rdquo; never
appears.&nbsp; Horses were now used underground for bringing the coal-trams
to the foot of the pit, and all the workings were accurately surveyed and
recorded, agreeably to the regulations instituted by the Dean Forest Mining
Commissioners, under the judicious Act of 27th July, 1838, to the effect
that &ldquo;the quantity of coals sent daily from each colliery should be
duly entered, and plans made of the workings, for the information of the
Gaveller, who might also inspect any underground operations at all
reasonable times,&rdquo; the whole undertaking being required to be carried
on according to the best and most <!-- page 241--><a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>improved system.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p241.jpg">
<img alt="Light Moor Colliery" src="images/p241.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In accordance with which excellent rules, each of the 105 re-awards of
coal seams applied for during the years 1838&ndash;41 were so ably set out
by Messrs. Sopwith, Buddle, and Probyn, as effectually to check the
numerous disputes which formerly arose, and ere long so to develop the
coal-works of the Forest <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>of Dean as to render them worthy to be
compared with some of the finest collieries in the kingdom.&nbsp; As an
instance of their present excellence, Messrs. Crawshay&rsquo;s colliery at
Light Moor may be mentioned, for its great extent, completeness, powerful
machinery, and size of its pits.&nbsp; These last, four in number, are 291
feet deep, one of which, measuring 9 feet 6 inches by 14 feet, contains
pumps raising 88 gallons of water per minute.</p>
<p>The number of coal-works in the Forest at the close of 1856 was 221,
yielding in that year to the public use upwards of 460,432 tons; the ten
largest collieries each producing as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Probably a twentieth part of the above total should he added to the
amount charged, in consideration of the quantity consumed by the colliery
engines, thus making the gross annual produce a third of a million of

<p class="headingsummary"><i>The Geology of the Forest, and its
Minerals</i>&mdash;Their character in general&mdash;Description of the beds
of conglomerate, mountain limestone, iron veins, millstone grit, and lower
coal measures&mdash;&ldquo;The Coleford High Delf&rdquo;&mdash;Elevation of
the Forest range of hills&mdash;The middle coal veins&mdash;The upper
veins&mdash;Mr. Mushet&rsquo;s analysis of the Forest coal&mdash;Their
fossils&mdash;The stone-quarries of the district.</p>
<p>The geological conditions of the Forest of Dean merit careful
observation, not only as regards the mineral wealth comprised within its
limits, but as explanatory of its undulations, and the means of maintenance
for its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The strata of the Forest repose in a basin-like form, the greatest
depression being near the centre; the longer axis extending from N. to S.
about eleven miles, and the transverse axis, in the widest part, ranging
from E. to W. about seven miles.&nbsp; The general observer, if he takes
his stand on the edge of hills by which this basin is bounded, will see the
enclosing character of the ridge, as well as the less conspicuous circle of
somewhat elevated land occupying the central portion of the field, and
which is separated by a valley or plain from the surrounding ridge.</p>
<p>This outlying ridge marks in most places the outcrop of the
Conglomerate, Mountain Limestone, Iron Veins, Millstone Grit, and Lower
Coal-measures.</p>
<p>Mr. Maclauchlan&rsquo;s geological map of the district exhibits the
course of the conglomerate bed, and the consequent disappearance of the old
red sandstone formation under the Dean Forest basin.&nbsp; Occasionally
this conglomerate, or hard grit, forms two distinct beds, very distant from
one another, near Lydney for instance, and on the Kimin Hill and Buckstone,
although it is sometimes cut <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>off altogether by a &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; as
opposite Blackney.&nbsp; It varies in hardness as well as in the number of
the pebbles, and not unfrequently presents an abrupt fall at its
termination, as at &ldquo;the Harkening Rock&rdquo; in the Highmeadow
Woods.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>The upper portion of the bed is soft, and acquires the character
of the limestone clay, often throwing out springs, such as St.
Anthony&rsquo;s Well, which have accumulated in the limestone rocks
above.&nbsp; A very micaceous stone sometimes occurs in the upper parts,
having the appearance of silver: hence the name of &ldquo;Silver
Stone&rdquo; given to a spot near the Hawthorns, where it is found.&nbsp;
The surface which the carboniferous limestone exposes is also represented
in the map.&nbsp; The Forest coal-field is surrounded by this formation,
with the exception of the line of fault between Lydney Park and Danby
Lodge, a distance of four miles.</p>
<p>The principal iron-mine train of the district divides into a lower or
more crystalline, and an upper or more argillaceous and sandy
stratum.&nbsp; Mr. Mushet thus describes this important metallic
vein:&mdash;&ldquo;The iron ores of the Forest of Dean, which have become
intimately known to me, are found, like the ores of Cumberland and
Lancashire, in churns or caverns formed in the upper beds of the mountain
or carboniferous limestone.&nbsp; The leaner ores contain a great deal of
calcareous matter in the shape of common limestone or spar, which reduces
the percentage in the ore as low as between 15 and 25 per cent., and it
seldom exceeds 25, except when mixed with fragments of what is called brush
ore, which, when in quantity, raises the percentage to 40 or 45.&nbsp;
Brush ore is a hydrate with protoxide of iron, and frequently, if not much
mixed with calcareous earth, contains from 60 to 65 per cent. of
iron.&nbsp; These ores are found in chambers, the walls of which are
exceedingly hard limestone, crystallized in rhombs.&nbsp; This limestone is
called the &lsquo;crease,&rsquo; and is frequently found enveloped and
covered with the iron ore.&nbsp; The miner has to cut his way through this
crystallized limestone from chamber to chamber, a distance of from 20 to
100 yards, before he reaches the next of these deposits, which are
sometimes found to contain 3,000 or 4,000 tons of ore.&nbsp; The principal
part of the ore is then dug easily, somewhat like gravel; but the sides of
the chambers are often covered with the stony ore before described, which
requires gunpowder to detach it from the rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; These various
ores were found by the same excellent authority to yield iron in the
following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Forest consider the ores obtained on the east
side superior to those on the west.&nbsp; They likewise suppose, but
probably without foundation, that the ore will be found to deteriorate in
proportion as the workings descend.&nbsp; Red and yellow ochre of superior
quality occur in the iron veins, and have at various times been in
considerable request.&nbsp; They are now used in the neighbourhood for
marking sheep, and tinting whitewash.</p>
<p>Reverting to the limestone beds of the district, the lower veins are
locally called &ldquo;blue stone,&rdquo; the middle &ldquo;red
stone,&rdquo; and the top vein the &ldquo;white head,&rdquo; which is
largely used as a flux in the smelting furnaces.&nbsp; The researches of
Mr. R. Gibbs, of Mitcheldean, have enabled him to furnish me with the

formation:&mdash;</p>

249</span>The millstone grit beds immediately succeed those of the
carboniferous limestone just described, forming a similar belt round the
Forest, and disappearing with it on the Blakeney side of the basin.&nbsp;
Its chief interest consists in the circumstance that it has been employed
from very early times as a material for building; for though it contains a
vein of iron ore, little has been done in mining it.&nbsp; Most of the old
buildings adjoining the parts where this grit crops out are formed of it,
as several of the ancient neighbouring churches show, and likewise the
oldest lodges in the Forest; now, however, this kind of stone is seldom
used except for boundary walls, and such kind of rough work.</p>
<p>The rest of the outer circle of high land, on whose summit the observer
has been supposed to be standing, and which so definitely marks the Forest
coal-field, comprises the <i>lower</i> coal measures, containing the lower
and upper Trenchard veins, the Coleford High Delf, with the Whittington and
Nag&rsquo;s Head seams, which together give about eleven feet of
coal.&nbsp; Of these the Coleford High Delf, averaging a thickness of
upwards of five feet, and extending over an area of 16,000 acres, is
undoubtedly the chief, although in some places it has suffered from various
disturbances, the principal of which occur in the neighbourhood of
Coleford, extending in a line from Worcester Lodge to Berry Hill, and is
marked on the surface by a succession of pools, named Howler&rsquo;s Well,
Leech Pool, Crabtree Pool, Hooper&rsquo;s Pool, and Hall&rsquo;s
Pool.&nbsp; Mr. Buddle describes the width as varying from 170 to 340 yards
in the most defined part, called by the colliers the &ldquo;Horse,&rdquo;
and the dislocations adjoining, the &ldquo;Lows.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not,&rdquo; he remarks, &ldquo;what geologists term a <i>fault</i>, as
there is no accompanying dislocation of the adjoining strata.&nbsp; In its
underground character it is similar to those <i>washes</i> or aqueous
deposits in many coal districts, but it differs from them in not being
under the bed of any river, nor in the bottom of a valley, nor does it show
itself at the surface.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he adds, &ldquo;On considering the
various ph&aelig;nomena presented by this fault, and the seam of coal on
each side of it, we may infer that it occupies the site of a lake which
existed at the period of the deposition of the High Delf seam, and that
<!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>the carbonaceous matter which formed the seam was accumulated
while the water was deep and tranquil.&nbsp; On the water being discharged
from the lake, the &lsquo;Horse&rsquo; itself occupied the bed of the
river, by which the complete drainage of the lake was effected, and which
washed the coal entirely out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same scientific observer records an extraordinary depression about
half a mile to the south-east, in the direction of the &ldquo;Horse,&rdquo;
and in the same seam of coal, amounting to about twenty feet in depth, and
of an oval shape.&nbsp; Various other defects and disturbances in the
Coleford High Delf are detected from time to time by the new workings,
especially in those places where the surface is most uneven.&nbsp; Thus its
outcrop at Lydney is very imperfectly defined, and at Oakwood Mill the vein
is rendered worthless by a fault, whilst on each side of the Lydbrook
valley there is a contortion, by which it is thrown down in one instance
seventy yards, and in two others thirty yards each.</p>
<p>Such is the geological character of the conspicuous range of hills by
which the Dean Forest coal-field is bounded, especially on its north and
east sides.&nbsp; The following table gives their height in feet at certain
places above the sea:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nearly all these spots afford magnificent views of the surrounding
country, reaching as far as the Coteswold, Sedgebarrow, Malvern,
Herefordshire, Welsh, and Monmouthshire heights, relieved intermediately by
the windings of the Severn, cultivated plains, and woodland.&nbsp; Several
very striking ravines intersect this Forest range, particularly at
Lydbrook, Blackpool Brook, and <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Ruspedge, such as would afford the artist many
beautiful and interesting subjects for delineation.&nbsp; One of the hills,
viz. that on which Mr. Colchester&rsquo;s house, called &ldquo;the
Wilderness,&rdquo; is situated, affords a prospect rarely equalled.&nbsp;
The present residence dates from the year 1824, but it occupies a site
which was built upon as early as 1710, if not before, for the accommodation
of sporting parties in the days of Sir Duncombe Colchester, when its fine
sycamores and trees of &ldquo;the Beech Walk&rdquo; were most likely
planted.</p>
<p>Descending from the side of the hilly range on which the reader has been
supposed to stand towards the middle of the Forest, a plain is reached
varying in width from half a mile to little more than 100 yards, and
forming a band round the somewhat elevated centre of the district.&nbsp;
This circular valley or plain marks the outcrop of the middle series of
coal seams, not less than ten in number, the principal ones being the Smith
Coal, Lowery or Park End High Delf, Starkey, Rocky, and Upper and Lower
Churchway.&nbsp; The combined thickness of these beds may be said to
average 20 feet, and they are more argillaceous in character than the lower
beds, which in general are harder in their nature, and hence they afford
the larger portion of the fossiliferous remains observed and tabulated by
Mr. R. Gibbs, who has kindly furnished the writer with the
following&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Plant&aelig;</span>.</p>
<p><i>Asterophyllites</i> equisetiformis, et foliosus.</p>
<p><i>Bothrodendron</i> punctatum.</p>
<p><i>Calamites</i> approximatus, nodosus.</p>
<p><i>Caulopteris</i> prim&aelig;va.</p>
<p><i>Lepidodendron</i> dichotomum, et elegans, et Serlii, et Sternbergii,
et majus.</p>
<p><i>Neuropteris</i> acutifolia, et angustifolia, et flexuosa, et

<p><i>Pecopteris</i> abbreviata, et arborescens, et cristata, et dentata,
et Serlii.</p>

252</span>The same variations in thickness as well as &ldquo;faults&rdquo;
which have been detected in the lower coal seams, occur in the middle
measures, although they do not in any case assume the same magnitude as the
&ldquo;Horse&rdquo; in the Coleford High Delf.</p>
<p>The heart of the Forest basin is well defined by its forming a slightly
varied plateau, containing the inferior and comparatively unimportant seams
of Woor Green coal, situated of course nearer to the surface than the other
veins, but as yet only sparingly worked, and not accurately defined in its
outcrop.&nbsp; The highest elevations in this portion of the district
are:&mdash;Surridge, 658 feet; Speech-house, 581 feet; St. Paul&rsquo;s,
Park End, 270 feet.&nbsp; The combined vertical thickness of the entire
formation, descending from the top surface to the old red sandstone, is
calculated by Mr. D. Williams at 2,765 feet, an opinion which is
corroborated by Mr. Atkinson&rsquo;s highly interesting sections based on
his practical acquaintance with the mining operations of the Forest.</p>
<p>Mr. Mushet obtained by analysis the following percentage of carbon in
the various descriptions of coal, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>None of these sorts of coal emit &ldquo;fire-damp&rdquo; in their
natural condition&mdash;a fact which adds so much to the safety of the
pits; but &ldquo;choke-damp&rdquo; is very prevalent.</p>
<p>The sandstone matrix of these coal-beds constitutes the grey and
buff-coloured rock so well known in the neighbourhood of the Forest as a
valuable building material, as well as for ornamental stonework.&nbsp;
Although for many years past it has been generally preferred to the
gritstone of the district, and is commonly met with in the better specimens
of stonework on this side the <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>Severn, of which Mr. Telford&rsquo;s Over
Bridge and Lord Somers&rsquo;s mansion at Eastnor are examples, yet
originally such was not the case, since the earliest example of its being
used for any considerable pieces of masonry occurs in the steeple of
Ruerdean Church, a work of the 15th century.&nbsp; Now, however, almost all
the 320 stone quarries worked in the Forest are of this stone, which is
very pleasing in tint, and, if judiciously selected, very durable.</p>

<h3>No. I.<br />
Papers preserved in the Lansdowne Collection at the British Museum.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Right Honourable,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acoording unto your Lordship&rsquo;s warrant, Wee repaired unto
and have veiwed and duelie considered the severall woodes, known by the
names of Great Bradley, Little Bradley, Stonegrove, Pigstade, Buckholde
Moore, and the Copps; all lying together and conteyning by the measure of
16&frac12; foote the pole, 520 acres.&nbsp; In w<sup>ch</sup> grounds we
thinke (the woodes being muche differing in qualitie, by an equall
proportion) there maie be raised for everie acre 30 coard of woode;
reserving sufficient staddells according to the state, w<sup>ch</sup>,
according to the measure of the said grounds, amounted unto the number of
15,600 cordes of woode.&nbsp; Uppon conference with divers in the contrie,
wee finde that such a quantitie of woode is not suddainly to be vented in
anie other sorte then to the iron workes, w<sup>ch</sup> causeth either the
cheapnes or dearnes of the same; the contrie not vallewing the said woodes
uppon the stem above <span class="smcap">xiiiid</span> the coard, although
to the iron workes it may be vallued at II<sup>s</sup> VI<sup>d</sup> the
coard.&nbsp; So that according to the rate of the contrie, the said
proportion of woode is worthe <span class="smcap">cccccv</span> li.&nbsp;
And according to the compictacon for the iron works, the same maie be
vallued at <span class="smcap">mixclx</span> li.&nbsp; We imagine that the
charge of ffensing the said woodes, circuting 4 miles, will cost, to be
done and kept according to the state, aboute <span class="smcap">cc</span>
markes.&nbsp; The rent is 20 li. per ann.</p>

<p>The wood standing in the 6 copses above named, Sir Edward Winter
proposed to buy for 800 lib., cutting and carrying away the same, one copse
after another, in 5 years&rsquo; time.&nbsp; But this proposal was so
impugned as to elicit the ensuing defence from Sir E.
Winter:&mdash;&ldquo;A true Answere to <!-- page 256--><a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>the objections made
against my late bargaine for some of his M<sup>ties</sup> coppices or
colletts adioyning to the fforest of Deane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;1.&nbsp; Ffirst, that contrarie to the intention of this
bargaine, I have alredie cut downe a great number of tymber-trees, whereas
to this howre not any one is felled of that kynde or any other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;2.&nbsp; That a follower of my L<sup>d</sup> of
Worcester&rsquo;s should survey those woodes is a wilful mistakinge, synce
by the particules it appeares that one M<sup>r</sup> Hervye made this
survey by warrant from the late L. Trer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;3.&nbsp; That I should gaine a 1000 li. per ann. by this
bargaine is soe vayre and ympossible a thing as deserves noe Aunswere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yet that your L<sup>pp</sup> maye see howe much Th&rsquo;
informer hath exceeded therein, himselfe or any man els <i>shall purchase
my interest for a tenth parte of his valuation</i>.&nbsp; Which I write not
in any sorte to capitulate with your L<sup>pp</sup>; for w<sup>th</sup>out
any consideration at all, I am redie to yealde upp this bargaine, rather
then by reteyning thereof to harbour in your noblest thoughts the least ill
conceipt of mee or my proceedinges.&nbsp; But nowe, S<sup>r</sup>, howe
profitable a bargaine you have made for the Kinge, these considerations
followinge will easely demonstrate&mdash;ffor whereas in former tyme a
greater proffit was never raised out of these wooddes than <span
class="smcap">xxvs</span> per ann. vntill my L<sup>d</sup> your ffather and
S<sup>r</sup> Walter Myldemaye did let them by lease, and soe made <span
class="smcap">viili</span> rent, w<sup>th</sup>out any ffyne, your
L<sup>pp</sup> hath now made 500<sup>li</sup> ffyne, and 20<sup>li</sup>
rent, w<sup>ch</sup> is noe smale improvement, consideringe that <i>these
25 yeares last past not one pennye rent or proffitt otherwise hath bene
made out of them, but left as a thing forgotten</i>.&nbsp; That the coppice
woodd or vnderwoodd through the abuse of the last ffarmer, who never
inclosed these wooddes, and the contynuall spoyle and havocke of the
country thereabouts, <i>is utterly destroyed</i>.&nbsp; That there is
nothinge nowe eft in 4 of those 6 coppices for w<sup>ch</sup> I have
bargained but old beaches, heretofore topt and lopt, whereof many of them
nowe are scarce worth the cuttinge out to any man but myselfe, in respect
of my iron workes beinge soe nere to them.&nbsp; That the other twoe
coppices which are well stored have nothinge in them but younge beaches,
and some other woodd of <span class="smcap">xx</span> or <span
class="smcap">xxx</span> yeares growth.&nbsp; That in dyvers of those
coppices there are many acres w<sup>ch</sup> have noe manner of woodd
standing vpon them at all.&nbsp; Lastly, <!-- page 257--><a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>that the enclosinge
of these coppices w<sup>th</sup> a sufficient mound will cost me 200 markes
the least, beside the great quantitie of woodd that must necessarilye be
spent therein, for w<sup>ch</sup> no manner of allowance is made mee,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next MS. in Sir J. C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s collection seems designed to
promote the extension of the iron-works, and relates several interesting
particulars.&nbsp; It is headed &ldquo;Reasons to move his M<sup>tie</sup>
to make vse and profitt of the woodes within the fforest of
Deane.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Forest woods are said to &ldquo;containe of great
standing woodes, though of severall and different sortes, 15,000 acres,
parte beinge tymber, and parte other, the most parte well sett, the lawndes
not accompted.&nbsp; The same fforest is a forest for waste, and of soe ill
condic&otilde;n for hunting, as that the preservinge the woodes thereof
will nether yield pleasure to the hunter nor profitt to the owner; and the
woodes thereupon soe subject to waste, will dayly grow worse and
worse.&nbsp; The fforest is for II. or III. myles vpon the skirts soe
exceedingly wasted, as well by the inhabitants as other the borderers
adiacent, that yt is grief to see soe many goodly trees to be spoiled, the
vse whereof hath bene such as yt hath converted the tymber trees to
Dotards, and that almost generally vpon the borders of the same
fforest.&nbsp; The liberty of makinge sale of the wood hath bred in the
same such a multitude of poore creatures, as it is lamentable to thinke soe
many inhabitants shall lyve vpon soe bare provision as vpon spoile of the
fforest woodes, w<sup>ch</sup> yf in tyme yt be not forseene, will consume
all his M<sup>ties</sup> woodes without accompte.&nbsp; It appeareth by
Recorde, that in the raigne of Henry III., Edward I., II., and III., and
longe sithence, there were divers forges within the fforest, and noe other
but the Kinge&rsquo;s only; and of these there were VIII. at one tyme, as
appeareth by the accompt of Maurice de S<sup>cto</sup> Amando, and the rest
were <i>Forgium Itinerans ad siccum in bosco de</i>, <i>&amp;c</i>.&nbsp;
All lyberty beinge prohibited for cuttinge of greene wood but to his
Ma<sup>tes</sup> owne forge.&nbsp; And whosoever cutt greene wood was by
the officer of the Bayliwycke attached for the same.&nbsp; Also by
negligence of former officers the inhabitantes of the said forest have much
insulted by cuttinge of trees in the said forest, whereas by Recorde it
appeareth the Kynge&rsquo;s Warrant was in former tymes obtayned for
cuttinge of deade trees, and who soe cutt, shredd, or lopped great wood
w<sup>th</sup>out good warrant, was from tyme to tyme attached, presented,
and made to paye for y<sup>e</sup> same.&nbsp; There are, to <!-- page
258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>keepe and
preserve the woodes of the said forest, tenn woodwardes, or Baylyfes of
ffee, who hould Landes by that service, viz. Per servitum custodiendi
boscum Domini Regis infra Ballinam, &amp;c.&nbsp; Yet late experience
proveth that they, their Tenauntes and Servantes, are as great spoilers as
any others.&nbsp; And the antient Recordes make menc&otilde;n, that some of
these woodwardes have forfeyted their Bayliwyckes, and have compounded
w<sup>th</sup> the Kinge to have them againe regranted.&nbsp; It appeareth
alsoe by Recordes, that the King hath bene answered of Browsewood
w<sup>th</sup>in the Forest of Deane, and therein is sett downe what ffees
were from tyme to tyme allowed to the keeper and what not.&nbsp; The
profitt to be made of the said woodes is either by convertinge the same to
coles, and soe for makinge iron or otherwise by sellinge of the tymber by
the tonne.&nbsp; In w<sup>ch</sup> disposition of the woodes there wil be
lytle or noe difference in advantage.&nbsp; But of the two the makinge of
coles will be lykely to yield most profitt.&rdquo;</p>

their interest:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The following letter of Mr. Vaughan</i>, <i>of Court Field on the
Wye</i>, <i>near Lydbrook, merits insertion</i>, <i>as bearing testimony to
the value of the preceding Tables compiled by Mr. Machen</i>, <i>exhibiting
the growth of Trees in the Forest</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Court Field, October 15, 1841.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you very much for the interesting account you have sent
me of the result of your observation during a series of years upon the
growth of trees.&nbsp; It is really a most curious document.&nbsp; I ought
to have thanked you sooner, but I was anxious, first, to compare your Table
with the result of my own admeasurements of trees at Court Field in various
situations; and give you, at the same time, the result of my
calculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find that my experience fully corroborates yours, though it
induces me to believe that the forest growth is slightly below an
average&mdash;which the soil and situation would also induce one to
imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I calculate, from your Table, that an oak-tree measuring 6 inches
girt doubles its contents (exclusive of its increase in height and limb) in
5 to 6 years.&nbsp; Whereas, a tree measuring 8&frac12; inches, or half a
foot girt, requires 10 or 12 years to double itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to the trees 170 years old, I find that A has
increased 19 feet or 28 per cent. only in 30 years, and B 26 feet or 48 per
cent. during the same period; neither, therefore, paying much interest on
their value within the last 30 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I calculate that the value of the acres of growing timber which
you refer to (73 oaks averaging 58 feet) would be &pound;624 at &pound;7
10s. per 50 feet; or, if the original value of the land and expense of
ploughing it amounted to &pound;25, about twenty-five times its original
value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the thinnings be considered equivalent to the expense of
protection-fences, &amp;c., and &pound;25 at compound interest for 170
years be calculated, &pound;624 will be found to be less than 1/20 per
cent. = a hundredth of 5 per cent. per annum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain, my dear Sir, very faithfully yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John V.
Vaughan</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same careful investigator (Mr. Wyrrall) of every particular relating
to the iron-works of the Forest formed a glossary of the terms used in the
above specifications, which not only sufficiently explains them, but also
shows that very similar apparatus continued to be used in this
neighbourhood up to the close of the last century.&nbsp; It proceeds
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sows of Iron</i> are the long pieces of cast iron as they run
into the sand immediately from the furnace; thus called from the appearance
of this and the shorter pieces which are runned into smaller gutters made
in the same sand, from the resemblance they have to a sow lying on her side
with her pigs at her dugs.&nbsp; These are for working up in the forges;
but it is usual to cast other sows of iron of very great size to lay in the
walls of the furnaces as beams to support the great strain of the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dam Plate</i> is a large flat plate of cast iron placed on its
edge against the front of the furnace, with a stone cut sloping and placed
on the inside.&nbsp; This plate has a notch on the top for the cinder or
scruff to run off, and a place at the side to discharge the metal at
casting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Shaft</i> of a wheel is a large round beam having the
wheel fixed near the one end of it, and turning upon gudgeons or centres
fixed in the two ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Furnace House</i> I take to be what we call the casting
house, where the metal runs out of the furnace into the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Bridge</i> is the place where the raw materials are laid
down ready to be thrown into the furnace.&nbsp; I conceive that it had its
name (which is still continued) from this circumstance&mdash;that in the
infancy of these works it was built as a bridge, hollow underneath.&nbsp;
It was not at first known what strength was required to support the blast
of a furnace bellows; and the consequence was that they were often out of
repair, and frequently obliged to be built almost entirely new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bellows Boards</i>&mdash;not very different from the present
dimensions.</p>
<p><!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;<i>Water Troughs</i>&mdash;scooped out of the solid
timber.&nbsp; This shows the great simplicity of these times, not 150 years
ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Hutch</i>, or as it is now corruptly called the Witch, a
wide covered drain below the furnace-wheel to carry off the water from it,
usually arched, but here only covered with timbers to support the rubbish
and earth thrown upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cambs</i> are iron cogs fixed in the shaft to work the bellows
as the wheel turns round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cinder Shovels</i>, iron shovels for taking up the cinders
into the boxes, both to measure them and to fill the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Moulding Ship</i>, an iron tool fixed on a wooden handle, so
formed as to make the gutters in the sand for casting the pig and sow
iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Casting Ladles</i>, made hollow like a dish, with a lip to
lade up the liquid iron for small castings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wringers</i>, large long bars of iron to wring the furnace,
that is to clear it of the grosser and least fluid cinder which rises on
the upper surface, and would there coagulate and soon prevent the furnace
from working aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Constable</i>, a bar of very great substance and length, kept
always lying by a furnace in readiness for extraordinary purposes in which
uncommon strength and purchase were required.&nbsp; I suppose this name to
have been given to this tool on account of its superior bulk and power, and
in allusion to the Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, an officer
heretofore of very great weight and consequence in this Forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cinder Hook</i>, a hook of iron for drawing away the scruff or
cinder which runs liquid out of the furnace over the dam plate, and soon
becomes a solid substance, which must be removed to make room for fresh
cinder to run out into its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Plackett</i>, a tool contrived as a kind of trowel for
smoothing and shaping the clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buckstones</i>, now called Buckstaves, are two thick plates of
iron, about 5 or 6 feet long, fixed one on each side of the front of the
furnace down to the ground to support the stone work.</p>
<p><!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>&ldquo;<i>Iron Tempe</i> is a plate fixed at the bottom of the
front wall of the furnace over the flame between the buck-staves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuiron Plate</i> is a plate of cast iron fixed before the
noses of the bellows, and so shaped as to conduct the blast into the body
of the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuiron Hooke</i>, a tool contrived for conveying a lump of
tempered clay before the point of the tuiron plate, to guard the wall from
wearing away as it would otherwise do in that part, there being the
greatest force of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shammel Plate</i>, a piece of cast iron fixed on a wooden
frame, in the shape of a &#9472;&#9472;&#9474;, which works up and down as
a crank, so as for the camb to lay hold of this iron, and thereby press
down the bellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Firketts</i> are large square pieces of timber laid upon the
upper woods of the bellows, to steady it and to work it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Firkett Hooks</i>, two strong hooks of square wrought iron
fixed at the smallest end of the bellows to keep it firm and in its
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gage</i>, two rods of iron jointed in the middle, with a ring
for the filler to drop the shortest end into the furnace at the top, to
know when it is worked down low enough to be charged again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Poises</i>, wooden beams, one over each bellows, fixed upon
centres across another very large beam; at the longest end of these poises
are open boxes bound with iron, and the little end being fixed with harness
to the upper ends of the firketts are thus pressed down, and the bellows
with it by the working of the wheel, while the weight of the poises lifts
them up alternately as the wheel goes round.&rdquo;</p>

Dr. Parson&rsquo;s description of the mode of making Iron.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;After they have provided their ore, their first work is to
calcine it, which is done in kilns, much after the fashion of our ordinary
lime-kilns; these they fill up to the top with coal and ore untill it be
full, and so putting fire to the bottom, they let it burn till the coal be
wasted, and then renew the kilnes with fresh ore and coal: this is done
without any infusion of mettal, and serves to consume the more drossy part
of the ore, and to make it fryable, supplying the beating and washing,
which are to no other mettals; from hence they carry it to their furnaces,
which are built of brick and stone, about 24 foot square on the outside,
and near 30 foot in hight within, and not above 8 or 10 foot over where it
is widest, which is about the middle, the top and bottom having a narrow
compass, much like the form of an egg.&nbsp; Behind the furnace are placed
two high pair of bellows, whose noses meet at a little hole near the
bottom: these are compressed together by certain buttons placed on the axis
of a very large wheel, which is turned round by water, in the manner of an
overshot mill.&nbsp; As soon as these buttons are slid off, the bellows are
raised again by a counterpoise of weights, whereby they are made to play
alternately, the one giving its blast whilst the other is rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first they fill these furnaces with ore and cinder intermixt
with fuel, which in these works is always charcoal, laying them hollow at
the bottom, that they may the more easily take fire; but after they are
once kindled, the materials run together into an hard cake or lump, which
is sustained by the furnace, and through this the mettal as it runs
trickles down the receivers, which are placed at the bottom, where there is
a passage open, by which they take away the scum and dross, and let out
their mettal as they see occasion.&nbsp; Before the mouth of the furnace
lyeth a great bed of sand, where they make furrows of the <!-- page
281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>fashion they
desire to cast their iron: into these, when the receivers are full, they
let in their mettal, which is made so very fluid by the violence of the
fire, that it not only runs to a considerable distance, but stands
afterwards boiling a great while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After these furnaces are once at work, they keep them constantly
employed for many months together, never suffering the fire to slacken
night or day, but still supplying the waste of fuel and other materials
with fresh, poured in at the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several attempts have been made to bring in the use of the sea
coal in these works instead of charcoal; the former being to be had at an
easy rate, the latter not without a great expence; but hitherto they have
proved ineffectual, the workmen finding by experience that a sea coal fire,
how vehement soever, will not penetrate the most fixed parts of the ore, by
which means they leave much of the mettal behind them unmelted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From these furnaces they bring the sows and piggs of iron, as
they call them, to their forges; these are two sorts, though they stood
together under the same roof; one they call their finery, and the other
chafers: both of them are upon hearths, upon which they place great heaps
of sea coal, and behind them bellows like those of the furnaces, but
nothing near so large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such finerys they first put their piggs of iron, placing three
or four of them together, behind the fire, with a little of one end thrust
into it, where softening by degrees they stir and work them with long barrs
of iron till the mettal runs together in a round masse or lump, which they
call an half bloome: this they take out, and giving it a few strokes with
their sledges, they carry it to a great weighty hammer, raised likewise by
the motion of a water-wheel, where applying it dexterously to the blows,
they presently beat it into a thick short square; this they put into the
finery again, and heating it red hot, they work it under the same hammer
till it comes to the shape of a bar in the middle, with two square knobs in
the ends; last of all they give it other beatings in the chaffers, and more
workings under the hammer, till they have brought their iron into barrs of
several shapes, in which fashion they expose them to sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All their principal iron undergoes the aforementioned
preparations, yet for several other purposes, as for backs <!-- page
282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>of chimneys,
hearths of ovens, and the like, they have a sort of cast iron, which they
take out of the receivers of the furnace, so soon as it is melted, in great
ladles, and pour it into the moulds of fine sand in like manner as they do
cast brass and softer mettals; but this sort of iron is so very brittle,
that, being heated with one blow of the hammer, it breaks all to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>

water and sludge, and very likely to destroy the levells, and put us by
getting a scale of coale there.&nbsp; And by their so doing, I and my
vearnes are dampnified thirty pounds.&nbsp; All this I will prove myself
and by evidence in the King&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another suit, dated 20th January, 1753, is also subjoined:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Dukes and his vernes, plaintiffs, <i>against</i> William
Keare and his vernes, defendants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We complain against William Keare and his vernes for wrongfully
forbidding us out of a stone coal work, called the Gentlemen Colliers,
within the Hundred of S<sup>t</sup> Briavels, that we should not get any
coal of the deep side of our former work, which coal our levell drains, and
ours being the most ancient level.&nbsp; <span class="sidenote">We leave
this to the best evidence.</span>We have attended the place, and burned our
light, according to our laws and customs, and through this wrong forbidd we
are dampnified five pounds.&nbsp; And whereas several forbidds have been
given before, we, the aforesaid plaintiffs and defendants, left the same to
the determination of Charles Godwin and Richard James, and we the said
plaintiffs have duly observed the said determination, and that the said
defendants have gone contrary to an order made by 48 free miners in getting
of coal that our levell would have drained, and have dampnified our levell,
whereby they have forfeited the penalty of the said Order.&nbsp; And this
we will prove by evidence, and the damages in getting coal we will leave to
the Order in C<sup>t</sup>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We deny the forbid given to him or his vernes.&nbsp; We forbidd
them in getting any coal betwixt our work and theirs, except their levell
could dry it fairly.&nbsp; There was an agreement betwixt us, and they went
contrary to the agreement, and this we will prove ourselves and by
witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is a copy of an Agreement, resembling no doubt the one mentioned
above:&mdash;</p>

his vearns shall have the liberty of getting what coale their leavel will
dry without being interrupted, but they shall not get coale by the strength
of hauling or laveing of water within the bounds of Robert Tingle and his
vearns, except to drowl their work, under the forfet of the sum of five
pounds; and we do farther agree that Robert Tingle and his vearns shall com
in at any time to see if they do carry on their work in a proper manner
without trespassing them; and if the foresaid James Bennet and his vearns
do interrupt them for comming in to see their work, they shall forfeit the
sum of five pounds.&nbsp; And we do order the partys to stand to their

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Hobbs.&nbsp; I do hereby, in his Majesty King George the
Third&rsquo;s name, being owner and chief gaveller of his Majesty&rsquo;s
Forest of Dean, in the county of Gloucester, and of the coal and mines
therein, forbid you, your verns, your servants, agents, or workmen, for
getting, diging, or raising any more stone coal out of any fire pitt or
pitts, or water pitt or pitts, a deep the Majors suff level gutter in the
said Forest, or to permit or suffer any stone coal to be got, dug, or
raised out of any such pitt or pitts, untill you have satisfied and paid me
his Majesty&rsquo;s gale and dues for working and getting coal in such
pitts for two years last past, and untill you agree with me for the gale
and dues of such pitt and pitts for the future.&nbsp; If you break this
forbid, you will incur the penalty of an Order made by forty-eight free
miners.</p>

<p>In the terms of a Memorandum, apparently of this date, or perhaps
earlier, it is said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place of gaveler within the Forest of Dean is <!-- page
286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>held by
patent from the Crown, &amp; by vertue of his office the gaveler hath a
right to put a man to work in every coalwork or work for iron mine within
the limitts of the Forest, or within any private person&rsquo;s property in
the hundred of S<sup>t</sup> Briavels (but not in any stone quarry that is
belonging to L<sup>d</sup> Berkeley).&nbsp; This right the gaveler never
makes use of by setting his man to work in the mine pitt or coalwork, but
lets it out to the partners of the work at such price as he can agree for,
which is from twenty shillings to three pounds a work.&rdquo;</p>

E&rsquo;er to leave my humble cot,<br />

To be happy with my lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For while storms spread desolation<br />
&lsquo;Mong the lofty trees around,<br />
In thy lowly situation<br />
Peace and safety may be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, when states and empires shaking<br />
Bid the rich and great beware,<br />
I, comparatively speaking,<br />
Am secure from strife and care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though the wintry blast should wither<br />
Thy pale blow&mdash;thy leaves decay,<br />
Gales, the first that spring sends hither,<br />
Thy perfume shall bear away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And like thee, I too shall perish,<br />
When my life&rsquo;s brief summer &lsquo;s o&rsquo;er;<br />
But there is a hope I cherish,<br />
To be blest for evermore.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
